{"lang":"Go","title":"Introduction","category":"","fullPath":"/Introduction","markdown":"## Introduction\n\nThis is the reference manual for the Go programming language. The pre-Go1.18 version, without generics, can be found[here](https://go.dev/doc/go1.17%5Fspec.html). For more information and other documents, see [golang.org](https://go.dev/).\n\nGo is a general-purpose language designed with systems programming in mind. It is strongly typed and garbage-collected and has explicit support for concurrent programming. Programs are constructed from_packages_, whose properties allow efficient management of dependencies.\n\nThe syntax is compact and simple to parse, allowing for easy analysis by automatic tools such as integrated development environments."}
