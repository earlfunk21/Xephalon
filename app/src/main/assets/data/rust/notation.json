These cases form a subset of the rules regarding the[token](tokens.html) rule, and are assumed to be the result of a lexical-analysis phase feeding the parser, driven by a DFA, operating over the disjunction of all such string table entries.\n\nWhen such a string in `monospace` font occurs inside the grammar, it is an implicit reference to a single member of such a string table production. See [tokens](tokens.html) for more information.\n\n[ ](introduction.html \"Previous chapter\") [ ](lexical-structure.html \"Next chapter\") "}
