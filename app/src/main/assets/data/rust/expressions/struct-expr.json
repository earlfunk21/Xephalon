It consists of a path to a [struct](../items/structs.html), [enum variant](../items/enumerations.html), or [union](../items/unions.html) item followed by the values for the fields of the item. There are three forms of struct expressions: struct, tuple, and unit.\n\nThe following are examples of struct expressions:\n\n```rust\n#![allow(unused)]\nfn main() {\nstruct Point { x: f64, y: f64 }\nstruct NothingInMe { }\nstruct TuplePoint(f64, f64);\nmod game { pub struct User<'a> { pub name: &'a str, pub age: u32, pub score: usize } }\nstruct Cookie; fn some_fn<T>(t: T) {}\nPoint {x: 10.0, y: 20.0};\nNothingInMe {};\nTuplePoint(10.0, 20.0);\nTuplePoint { 0: 10.0, 1: 20.0 }; // Results in the same value as the above line\nlet u = game::User {name: \"Joe\", age: 35, score: 100_000};\nsome_fn::<Cookie>(Cookie);\n}\n```\n\n## [Field struct expression](#field-struct-expression)\n\nA struct expression with fields enclosed in curly braces allows you to specify the value for each individual field in any order. The field name is separated from its value with a colon.\n\nA value of a [union](../items/unions.html) type can only be created using this syntax, and it must specify exactly one field.\n\n## [Functional update syntax](#functional-update-syntax)\n\nA struct expression that constructs a value of a struct type can terminate with the syntax `..` followed by an expression to denote a functional update. The expression following `..` (the base) must have the same struct type as the new struct type being formed.\n\nThe entire expression uses the given values for the fields that were specified and moves or copies the remaining fields from the base expression. As with all struct expressions, all of the fields of the struct must be [visible](../visibility-and-privacy.html), even those not explicitly named.\n\n```rust\n#![allow(unused)]\nfn main() {\nstruct Point3d { x: i32, y: i32, z: i32 }\nlet mut base = Point3d {x: 1, y: 2, z: 3};\nlet y_ref = &mut base.y;\nPoint3d {y: 0, z: 10, .. base}; // OK, only base.x is accessed\ndrop(y_ref);\n}\n```\n\nStruct expressions with curly braces can't be used directly in a [loop](loop-expr.html) or [if](if-expr.html#if-expressions) expression's head, or in the [scrutinee](../glossary.html#scrutinee) of an [if let](if-expr.html#if-let-expressions) or [match](match-expr.html) expression. However, struct expressions can be in used in these situations if they are within another expression, for example inside [parentheses](grouped-expr.html).\n\nThe field names can be decimal integer values to specify indices for constructing tuple structs. This can be used with base structs to fill out the remaining indices not specified:\n\n```rust\n#![allow(unused)]\nfn main() {\nstruct Color(u8, u8, u8);\nlet c1 = Color(0, 0, 0);  // Typical way of creating a tuple struct.\nlet c2 = Color{0: 255, 1: 127, 2: 0};  // Specifying fields by index.\nlet c3 = Color{1: 0, ..c2};  // Fill out all other fields using a base struct.\n}\n```\n\n### [Struct field init shorthand](#struct-field-init-shorthand)\n\nWhen initializing a data structure (struct, enum, union) with named (but not numbered) fields, it is allowed to write `fieldname` as a shorthand for `fieldname: fieldname`. This allows a compact syntax with less duplication. For example:\n\n```rust\n#![allow(unused)]\nfn main() {\nstruct Point3d { x: i32, y: i32, z: i32 }\nlet x = 0;\nlet y_value = 0;\nlet z = 0;\nPoint3d { x: x, y: y_value, z: z };\nPoint3d { x, y: y_value, z };\n}\n```\n\n## [Tuple struct expression](#tuple-struct-expression)\n\nA struct expression with fields enclosed in parentheses constructs a tuple struct. Though it is listed here as a specific expression for completeness, it is equivalent to a [call expression](call-expr.html) to the tuple struct's constructor. For example:\n\n```rust\n#![allow(unused)]\nfn main() {\nstruct Position(i32, i32, i32);\nPosition(0, 0, 0);  // Typical way of creating a tuple struct.\nlet c = Position;  // `c` is a function that takes 3 arguments.\nlet pos = c(8, 6, 7);  // Creates a `Position` value.\n}\n```\n\n## [Unit struct expression](#unit-struct-expression)\n\nA unit struct expression is just the path to a unit struct item. This refers to the unit struct's implicit constant of its value. The unit struct value can also be constructed with a fieldless struct expression. For example:\n\n```rust\n#![allow(unused)]\nfn main() {\nstruct Gamma;\nlet a = Gamma;  // Gamma unit value.\nlet b = Gamma{};  // Exact same value as `a`.\n}\n```\n\n[ ](../expressions/tuple-expr.html \"Previous chapter\") [ ](../expressions/call-expr.html \"Next chapter\") "}
