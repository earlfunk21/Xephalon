Many of the following operators can also be overloaded using traits in `std::ops` or `std::cmp`.\n\n## [Overflow](#overflow)\n\nInteger operators will panic when they overflow when compiled in debug mode. The `-C debug-assertions` and `-C overflow-checks` compiler flags can be used to control this more directly. The following things are considered to be overflow:\n\n* When `+`, `*` or binary `-` create a value greater than the maximum value, or less than the minimum value that can be stored.\n* Applying unary `-` to the most negative value of any signed integer type, unless the operand is a [literal expression](literal-expr.html#integer-literal-expressions) (or a literal expression standing alone inside one or more [grouped expressions](grouped-expr.html)).\n* Using `/` or `%`, where the left-hand argument is the smallest integer of a signed integer type and the right-hand argument is `-1`. These checks occur even when `-C overflow-checks` is disabled, for legacy reasons.\n* Using `<<` or `>>` where the right-hand argument is greater than or equal to the number of bits in the type of the left-hand argument, or is negative.\n\n> **Note**: The exception for literal expressions behind unary `-` means that forms such as `-128_i8` or `let j: i8 = -(128)` never cause a panic and have the expected value of -128.\n> \n> In these cases, the literal expression already has the most negative value for its type (for example, `128_i8` has the value -128) because integer literals are truncated to their type per the description in [Integer literal expressions](literal-expr.html#integer-literal-expressions).\n> \n> Negation of these most negative values leaves the value unchanged due to two's complement overflow conventions.\n> \n> In `rustc`, these most negative expressions are also ignored by the `overflowing_literals` lint check.\n\n## [Borrow operators](#borrow-operators)\n\n> **Syntax**  \n> _BorrowExpression_ :  \n> (`&`|`&&`) [_Expression_](../expressions.html)  \n> | (`&`|`&&`) `mut` [_Expression_](../expressions.html)\n\nThe `&` (shared borrow) and `&mut` (mutable borrow) operators are unary prefix operators. When applied to a [place expression](../expressions.html#place-expressions-and-value-expressions), this expressions produces a reference (pointer) to the location that the value refers to. The memory location is also placed into a borrowed state for the duration of the reference. For a shared borrow (`&`), this implies that the place may not be mutated, but it may be read or shared again. For a mutable borrow (`&mut`), the place may not be accessed in any way until the borrow expires.`&mut` evaluates its operand in a mutable place expression context. If the `&` or `&mut` operators are applied to a [value expression](../expressions.html#place-expressions-and-value-expressions), then a [temporary value](../expressions.html#temporaries) is created.\n\nThese operators cannot be overloaded.\n\n```rust\n#![allow(unused)]\nfn main() {\n{\n    // a temporary with value 7 is created that lasts for this scope.\n    let shared_reference = &7;\n}\nlet mut array = [-2, 3, 9];\n{\n    // Mutably borrows `array` for this scope.\n    // `array` may only be used through `mutable_reference`.\n    let mutable_reference = &mut array;\n}\n}\n```\n\nEven though `&&` is a single token ([the lazy 'and' operator](#lazy-boolean-operators)), when used in the context of borrow expressions it works as two borrows:\n\n```rust\n#![allow(unused)]\nfn main() {\n// same meanings:\nlet a = &&  10;\nlet a = & & 10;\n\n// same meanings:\nlet a = &&&&  mut 10;\nlet a = && && mut 10;\nlet a = & & & & mut 10;\n}\n```\n\n### [Raw address-of operators](#raw-address-of-operators)\n\nRelated to the borrow operators are the _raw address-of operators_, which do not have first-class syntax, but are exposed via the macros [ptr::addr\\_of!(expr)](../../std/ptr/macro.addr%5Fof.html) and [ptr::addr\\_of\\_mut!(expr)](../../std/ptr/macro.addr%5Fof%5Fmut.html). The expression `expr` is evaluated in place expression context.`ptr::addr_of!(expr)` then creates a const raw pointer of type `*const T` to the given place, and `ptr::addr_of_mut!(expr)` creates a mutable raw pointer of type `*mut T`.\n\nThe raw address-of operators must be used instead of a borrow operator whenever the place expression could evaluate to a place that is not properly aligned or does not store a valid value as determined by its type, or whenever creating a reference would introduce incorrect aliasing assumptions. In those situations, using a borrow operator would cause [undefined behavior](../behavior-considered-undefined.html) by creating an invalid reference, but a raw pointer may still be constructed using an address-of operator.\n\nThe following is an example of creating a raw pointer to an unaligned place through a `packed` struct:\n\n```rust\n#![allow(unused)]\nfn main() {\nuse std::ptr;\n\n#[repr(packed)]\nstruct Packed {\n    f1: u8,\n    f2: u16,\n}\n\nlet packed = Packed { f1: 1, f2: 2 };\n// `&packed.f2` would create an unaligned reference, and thus be Undefined Behavior!\nlet raw_f2 = ptr::addr_of!(packed.f2);\nassert_eq!(unsafe { raw_f2.read_unaligned() }, 2);\n}\n```\n\nThe following is an example of creating a raw pointer to a place that does not contain a valid value:\n\n```rust\n#![allow(unused)]\nfn main() {\nuse std::{ptr, mem::MaybeUninit};\n\nstruct Demo {\n    field: bool,\n}\n\nlet mut uninit = MaybeUninit::<Demo>::uninit();\n// `&uninit.as_mut().field` would create a reference to an uninitialized `bool`,\n// and thus be Undefined Behavior!\nlet f1_ptr = unsafe { ptr::addr_of_mut!((*uninit.as_mut_ptr()).field) };\nunsafe { f1_ptr.write(true); }\nlet init = unsafe { uninit.assume_init() };\n}\n```\n\n## [The dereference operator](#the-dereference-operator)\n\n> **Syntax**  \n> _DereferenceExpression_ :  \n> `*` [_Expression_](../expressions.html)\n\nThe `*` (dereference) operator is also a unary prefix operator. When applied to a [pointer](../types/pointer.html) it denotes the pointed-to location. If the expression is of type `&mut T` or `*mut T`, and is either a local variable, a (nested) field of a local variable or is a mutable [place expression](../expressions.html#place-expressions-and-value-expressions), then the resulting memory location can be assigned to. Dereferencing a raw pointer requires `unsafe`.\n\nOn non-pointer types `*x` is equivalent to `*std::ops::Deref::deref(&x)` in an [immutable place expression context](../expressions.html#mutability) and `*std::ops::DerefMut::deref_mut(&mut x)` in a mutable place expression context.\n\n```rust\n#![allow(unused)]\nfn main() {\nlet x = &7;\nassert_eq!(*x, 7);\nlet y = &mut 9;\n*y = 11;\nassert_eq!(*y, 11);\n}\n```\n\n## [The question mark operator](#the-question-mark-operator)\n\n> **Syntax**  \n> _ErrorPropagationExpression_ :  \n> [_Expression_](../expressions.html) `?`\n\nThe question mark operator (`?`) unwraps valid values or returns erroneous values, propagating them to the calling function. It is a unary postfix operator that can only be applied to the types `Result<T, E>` and `Option<T>`.\n\nWhen applied to values of the `Result<T, E>` type, it propagates errors. If the value is `Err(e)`, then it will return `Err(From::from(e))` from the enclosing function or closure. If applied to `Ok(x)`, then it will unwrap the value to evaluate to `x`.\n\n```rust\n#![allow(unused)]\nfn main() {\nuse std::num::ParseIntError;\nfn try_to_parse() -> Result<i32, ParseIntError> {\n    let x: i32 = \"123\".parse()?; // x = 123\n    let y: i32 = \"24a\".parse()?; // returns an Err() immediately\n    Ok(x + y)                    // Doesn't run.\n}\n\nlet res = try_to_parse();\nprintln!(\"{:?}\", res);\nassert!(res.is_err())\n}\n```\n\nWhen applied to values of the `Option<T>` type, it propagates `None`s. If the value is `None`, then it will return `None`. If applied to `Some(x)`, then it will unwrap the value to evaluate to `x`.\n\n```rust\n#![allow(unused)]\nfn main() {\nfn try_option_some() -> Option<u8> {\n    let val = Some(1)?;\n    Some(val)\n}\nassert_eq!(try_option_some(), Some(1));\n\nfn try_option_none() -> Option<u8> {\n    let val = None?;\n    Some(val)\n}\nassert_eq!(try_option_none(), None);\n}\n```\n\n`?` cannot be overloaded.\n\n## [Negation operators](#negation-operators)\n\n> **Syntax**  \n> _NegationExpression_ :  \n> `-` [_Expression_](../expressions.html)  \n> | `!` [_Expression_](../expressions.html)\n\nThese are the last two unary operators. This table summarizes the behavior of them on primitive types and which traits are used to overload these operators for other types. Remember that signed integers are always represented using two's complement. The operands of all of these operators are evaluated in [value expression context](../expressions.html#place-expressions-and-value-expressions) so are moved or copied.\n\n| Symbol | Integer     | bool                                             | Floating Point | Overloading Trait |\n| ------ | ----------- | ------------------------------------------------ | -------------- | ----------------- |\n| \\-     | Negation\\*  | Negation                                         | std::ops::Neg  |                   |\n| !      | Bitwise NOT | [Logical NOT](../types/boolean.html#logical-not) | std::ops::Not  |                   |\n\n\\* Only for signed integer types.\n\nHere are some example of these operators\n\n```rust\n#![allow(unused)]\nfn main() {\nlet x = 6;\nassert_eq!(-x, -6);\nassert_eq!(!x, -7);\nassert_eq!(true, !false);\n}\n```\n\n## [Arithmetic and Logical Binary Operators](#arithmetic-and-logical-binary-operators)\n\n> **Syntax**  \n> _ArithmeticOrLogicalExpression_ :  \n> [_Expression_](../expressions.html) `+` [_Expression_](../expressions.html)  \n> | [_Expression_](../expressions.html) `-` [_Expression_](../expressions.html)  \n> | [_Expression_](../expressions.html) `*` [_Expression_](../expressions.html)  \n> | [_Expression_](../expressions.html) `/` [_Expression_](../expressions.html)  \n> | [_Expression_](../expressions.html) `%` [_Expression_](../expressions.html)  \n> | [_Expression_](../expressions.html) `&` [_Expression_](../expressions.html)  \n> | [_Expression_](../expressions.html) `|` [_Expression_](../expressions.html)  \n> | [_Expression_](../expressions.html) `^` [_Expression_](../expressions.html)  \n> | [_Expression_](../expressions.html) `<<` [_Expression_](../expressions.html)  \n> | [_Expression_](../expressions.html) `>>` [_Expression_](../expressions.html)\n\nBinary operators expressions are all written with infix notation. This table summarizes the behavior of arithmetic and logical binary operators on primitive types and which traits are used to overload these operators for other types. Remember that signed integers are always represented using two's complement. The operands of all of these operators are evaluated in [value expression context](../expressions.html#place-expressions-and-value-expressions) so are moved or copied.\n\n| Symbol | Integer           | bool                                             | Floating Point      | Overloading Trait      | Overloading Compound Assignment Trait |\n| ------ | ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------ | ------------------- | ---------------------- | ------------------------------------- |\n| +      | Addition          | Addition                                         | std::ops::Add       | std::ops::AddAssign    |                                       |\n| \\-     | Subtraction       | Subtraction                                      | std::ops::Sub       | std::ops::SubAssign    |                                       |\n| \\*     | Multiplication    | Multiplication                                   | std::ops::Mul       | std::ops::MulAssign    |                                       |\n| /      | Division\\*        | Division                                         | std::ops::Div       | std::ops::DivAssign    |                                       |\n| %      | Remainder\\*\\*     | Remainder                                        | std::ops::Rem       | std::ops::RemAssign    |                                       |\n| &      | Bitwise AND       | [Logical AND](../types/boolean.html#logical-and) | std::ops::BitAnd    | std::ops::BitAndAssign |                                       |\n| \\|     | Bitwise OR        | [Logical OR](../types/boolean.html#logical-or)   | std::ops::BitOr     | std::ops::BitOrAssign  |                                       |\n| ^      | Bitwise XOR       | [Logical XOR](../types/boolean.html#logical-xor) | std::ops::BitXor    | std::ops::BitXorAssign |                                       |\n| <<     | Left Shift        | std::ops::Shl                                    | std::ops::ShlAssign |                        |                                       |\n| \\>>    | Right Shift\\*\\*\\* | std::ops::Shr                                    | std::ops::ShrAssign |                        |                                       |\n\n\\* Integer division rounds towards zero.\n\n\\*\\* Rust uses a remainder defined with [truncating division](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modulo%5Foperation#Variants%5Fof%5Fthe%5Fdefinition). Given `remainder = dividend % divisor`, the remainder will have the same sign as the dividend.\n\n\\*\\*\\* Arithmetic right shift on signed integer types, logical right shift on unsigned integer types.\n\nHere are examples of these operators being used.\n\n```rust\n#![allow(unused)]\nfn main() {\nassert_eq!(3 + 6, 9);\nassert_eq!(5.5 - 1.25, 4.25);\nassert_eq!(-5 * 14, -70);\nassert_eq!(14 / 3, 4);\nassert_eq!(100 % 7, 2);\nassert_eq!(0b1010 & 0b1100, 0b1000);\nassert_eq!(0b1010 | 0b1100, 0b1110);\nassert_eq!(0b1010 ^ 0b1100, 0b110);\nassert_eq!(13 << 3, 104);\nassert_eq!(-10 >> 2, -3);\n}\n```\n\n## [Comparison Operators](#comparison-operators)\n\n> **Syntax**  \n> _ComparisonExpression_ :  \n> [_Expression_](../expressions.html) `==` [_Expression_](../expressions.html)  \n> | [_Expression_](../expressions.html) `!=` [_Expression_](../expressions.html)  \n> | [_Expression_](../expressions.html) `>` [_Expression_](../expressions.html)  \n> | [_Expression_](../expressions.html) `<` [_Expression_](../expressions.html)  \n> | [_Expression_](../expressions.html) `>=` [_Expression_](../expressions.html)  \n> | [_Expression_](../expressions.html) `<=` [_Expression_](../expressions.html)\n\nComparison operators are also defined both for primitive types and many types in the standard library. Parentheses are required when chaining comparison operators. For example, the expression `a == b == c` is invalid and may be written as `(a == b) == c`.\n\nUnlike arithmetic and logical operators, the traits for overloading these operators are used more generally to show how a type may be compared and will likely be assumed to define actual comparisons by functions that use these traits as bounds. Many functions and macros in the standard library can then use that assumption (although not to ensure safety). Unlike the arithmetic and logical operators above, these operators implicitly take shared borrows of their operands, evaluating them in [place expression context](../expressions.html#place-expressions-and-value-expressions):\n\n```rust\n#![allow(unused)]\nfn main() {\nlet a = 1;\nlet b = 1;\na == b;\n// is equivalent to\n::std::cmp::PartialEq::eq(&a, &b);\n}\n```\n\nThis means that the operands don't have to be moved out of.\n\n| Symbol | Meaning                  | Overloading method       |\n| ------ | ------------------------ | ------------------------ |\n| \\==    | Equal                    | std::cmp::PartialEq::eq  |\n| !=     | Not equal                | std::cmp::PartialEq::ne  |\n| \\>     | Greater than             | std::cmp::PartialOrd::gt |\n| <      | Less than                | std::cmp::PartialOrd::lt |\n| \\>=    | Greater than or equal to | std::cmp::PartialOrd::ge |\n| <=     | Less than or equal to    | std::cmp::PartialOrd::le |\n\nHere are examples of the comparison operators being used.\n\n```rust\n#![allow(unused)]\nfn main() {\nassert!(123 == 123);\nassert!(23 != -12);\nassert!(12.5 > 12.2);\nassert!([1, 2, 3] < [1, 3, 4]);\nassert!('A' <= 'B');\nassert!(\"World\" >= \"Hello\");\n}\n```\n\n## [Lazy boolean operators](#lazy-boolean-operators)\n\n> **Syntax**  \n> _LazyBooleanExpression_ :  \n> [_Expression_](../expressions.html) `||` [_Expression_](../expressions.html)  \n> | [_Expression_](../expressions.html) `&&` [_Expression_](../expressions.html)\n\nThe operators `||` and `&&` may be applied to operands of boolean type. The `||` operator denotes logical 'or', and the `&&` operator denotes logical 'and'. They differ from `|` and `&` in that the right-hand operand is only evaluated when the left-hand operand does not already determine the result of the expression. That is, `||` only evaluates its right-hand operand when the left-hand operand evaluates to `false`, and `&&` only when it evaluates to `true`.\n\n```rust\n#![allow(unused)]\nfn main() {\nlet x = false || true; // true\nlet y = false && panic!(); // false, doesn't evaluate `panic!()`\n}\n```\n\n## [Type cast expressions](#type-cast-expressions)\n\n> **Syntax**  \n> _TypeCastExpression_ :  \n> [_Expression_](../expressions.html) `as` [_TypeNoBounds_](../types.html#type-expressions)\n\nA type cast expression is denoted with the binary operator `as`.\n\nExecuting an `as` expression casts the value on the left-hand side to the type on the right-hand side.\n\nAn example of an `as` expression:\n\n```rust\n#![allow(unused)]\nfn main() {\nfn sum(values: &[f64]) -> f64 { 0.0 }\nfn len(values: &[f64]) -> i32 { 0 }\nfn average(values: &[f64]) -> f64 {\n    let sum: f64 = sum(values);\n    let size: f64 = len(values) as f64;\n    sum / size\n}\n}\n```\n\n`as` can be used to explicitly perform [coercions](../type-coercions.html), as well as the following additional casts. Any cast that does not fit either a coercion rule or an entry in the table is a compiler error. Here `*T` means either `*const T` or `*mut T`. `m` stands for optional `mut` in reference types and `mut` or `const` in pointer types.\n\n| Type of e                                          | U                                                  | Cast performed by e as U               |\n| -------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------- |\n| Integer or Float type                              | Integer or Float type                              | Numeric cast                           |\n| Enumeration                                        | Integer type                                       | Enum cast                              |\n| bool or char                                       | Integer type                                       | Primitive to integer cast              |\n| u8                                                 | char                                               | u8 to char cast                        |\n| \\*T                                                | \\*V where V: Sized \\*                              | Pointer to pointer cast                |\n| \\*T where T: Sized                                 | Integer type                                       | Pointer to address cast                |\n| Integer type                                       | \\*V where V: Sized                                 | Address to pointer cast                |\n| &m₁ T                                              | \\*m₂ T \\*\\*                                        | Reference to pointer cast              |\n| &m₁ \\[T; n\\]                                       | \\*m₂ T \\*\\*                                        | Array to pointer cast                  |\n| [Function item](../types/function-item.html)       | [Function pointer](../types/function-pointer.html) | Function item to function pointer cast |\n| [Function item](../types/function-item.html)       | \\*V where V: Sized                                 | Function item to pointer cast          |\n| [Function item](../types/function-item.html)       | Integer                                            | Function item to address cast          |\n| [Function pointer](../types/function-pointer.html) | \\*V where V: Sized                                 | Function pointer to pointer cast       |\n| [Function pointer](../types/function-pointer.html) | Integer                                            | Function pointer to address cast       |\n| Closure \\*\\*\\*                                     | Function pointer                                   | Closure to function pointer cast       |\n\n\\* or `T` and `V` are compatible unsized types, e.g., both slices, both the same trait object.\n\n\\*\\* only when `m₁` is `mut` or `m₂` is `const`.

A pointer obtained from this cast may suffer additional restrictions even if it is bitwise equal to a valid pointer. Dereferencing such a pointer may be [undefined behavior](../behavior-considered-undefined.html) if aliasing rules are not followed.\n\nA trivial example of sound address arithmetic:\n\n```rust\n#![allow(unused)]\nfn main() {\nlet mut values: [i32; 2] = [1, 2];\nlet p1: *mut i32 = values.as_mut_ptr();\nlet first_address = p1 as usize;\nlet second_address = first_address + 4; // 4 == size_of::<i32>()\nlet p2 = second_address as *mut i32;\nunsafe {\n    *p2 += 1;\n}\nassert_eq!(values[1], 3);\n}\n```\n\n## [Assignment expressions](#assignment-expressions)\n\n> **Syntax**  \n> _AssignmentExpression_ :  \n> [_Expression_](../expressions.html) `=` [_Expression_](../expressions.html)\n\nAn _assignment expression_ moves a value into a specified place.\n\nAn assignment expression consists of a [mutable](../expressions.html#mutability) [assignee expression](../expressions.html#place-expressions-and-value-expressions), the _assignee operand_, followed by an equals sign (`=`) and a [value expression](../expressions.html#place-expressions-and-value-expressions), the _assigned value operand_. In its most basic form, an assignee expression is a [place expression](../expressions.html#place-expressions-and-value-expressions), and we discuss this case first. The more general case of destructuring assignment is discussed below, but this case always decomposes into sequential assignments to place expressions, which may be considered the more fundamental case.\n\n### [Basic assignments](#basic-assignments)\n\nEvaluating assignment expressions begins by evaluating its operands. The assigned value operand is evaluated first, followed by the assignee expression. For destructuring assignment, subexpressions of the assignee expression are evaluated left-to-right.\n\n> **Note**: This is different than other expressions in that the right operand is evaluated before the left one.\n\nIt then has the effect of first [dropping](../destructors.html) the value at the assigned place, unless the place is an uninitialized local variable or an uninitialized field of a local variable. Next it either [copies or moves](../expressions.html#moved-and-copied-types) the assigned value to the assigned place.\n\nAn assignment expression always produces [the unit value](../types/tuple.html).\n\nExample:\n\n```rust\n#![allow(unused)]\nfn main() {\nlet mut x = 0;\nlet y = 0;\nx = y;\n}\n```\n\n### [Destructuring assignments](#destructuring-assignments)\n\nDestructuring assignment is a counterpart to destructuring pattern matches for variable declaration, permitting assignment to complex values, such as tuples or structs. For instance, we may swap two mutable variables:\n\n```rust\n#![allow(unused)]\nfn main() {\nlet (mut a, mut b) = (0, 1);\n// Swap `a` and `b` using destructuring assignment.\n(b, a) = (a, b);\n}\n```\n\nIn contrast to destructuring declarations using `let`, patterns may not appear on the left-hand side of an assignment due to syntactic ambiguities. Instead, a group of expressions that correspond to patterns are designated to be [assignee expressions](../expressions.html#place-expressions-and-value-expressions), and permitted on the left-hand side of an assignment. Assignee expressions are then desugared to pattern matches followed by sequential assignment. The desugared patterns must be irrefutable: in particular, this means that only slice patterns whose length is known at compile-time, and the trivial slice `[..]`, are permitted for destructuring assignment.\n\nThe desugaring method is straightforward, and is illustrated best by example.\n\n```rust\n#![allow(unused)]\nfn main() {\nstruct Struct { x: u32, y: u32 }\nlet (mut a, mut b) = (0, 0);\n(a, b) = (3, 4);\n\n[a, b] = [3, 4];\n\nStruct { x: a, y: b } = Struct { x: 3, y: 4};\n\n// desugars to:\n\n{\n    let (_a, _b) = (3, 4);\n    a = _a;\n    b = _b;\n}\n\n{\n    let [_a, _b] = [3, 4];\n    a = _a;\n    b = _b;\n}\n\n{\n    let Struct { x: _a, y: _b } = Struct { x: 3, y: 4};\n    a = _a;\n    b = _b;\n}\n}\n```\n\nIdentifiers are not forbidden from being used multiple times in a single assignee expression.\n\n[Underscore expressions](./underscore-expr.html) and empty [range expressions](./range-expr.html) may be used to ignore certain values, without binding them.\n\nNote that default binding modes do not apply for the desugared expression.\n\n## [Compound assignment expressions](#compound-assignment-expressions)\n\n> **Syntax**  \n> _CompoundAssignmentExpression_ :  \n> [_Expression_](../expressions.html) `+=` [_Expression_](../expressions.html)  \n> | [_Expression_](../expressions.html) `-=` [_Expression_](../expressions.html)  \n> | [_Expression_](../expressions.html) `*=` [_Expression_](../expressions.html)  \n> | [_Expression_](../expressions.html) `/=` [_Expression_](../expressions.html)  \n> | [_Expression_](../expressions.html) `%=` [_Expression_](../expressions.html)  \n> | [_Expression_](../expressions.html) `&=` [_Expression_](../expressions.html)  \n> | [_Expression_](../expressions.html) `|=` [_Expression_](../expressions.html)  \n> | [_Expression_](../expressions.html) `^=` [_Expression_](../expressions.html)  \n> | [_Expression_](../expressions.html) `<<=` [_Expression_](../expressions.html)  \n> | [_Expression_](../expressions.html) `>>=` [_Expression_](../expressions.html)\n\n_Compound assignment expressions_ combine arithmetic and logical binary operators with assignment expressions.\n\nFor example:\n\n```rust\n#![allow(unused)]\nfn main() {\nlet mut x = 5;\nx += 1;\nassert!(x == 6);\n}\n```\n\nThe syntax of compound assignment is a [mutable](../expressions.html#mutability) [place expression](../expressions.html#place-expressions-and-value-expressions), the _assigned operand_, then one of the operators followed by an `=` as a single token (no whitespace), and then a [value expression](../expressions.html#place-expressions-and-value-expressions), the _modifying operand_.\n\nUnlike other place operands, the assigned place operand must be a place expression. Attempting to use a value expression is a compiler error rather than promoting it to a temporary.\n\nEvaluation of compound assignment expressions depends on the types of the operators.\n\nIf both types are primitives, then the modifying operand will be evaluated first followed by the assigned operand. It will then set the value of the assigned operand's place to the value of performing the operation of the operator with the values of the assigned operand and modifying operand.\n\n> **Note**: This is different than other expressions in that the right operand is evaluated before the left one.\n\nOtherwise, this expression is syntactic sugar for calling the function of the overloading compound assignment trait of the operator (see the table earlier in this chapter). A mutable borrow of the assigned operand is automatically taken.\n\nFor example, the following expression statements in `example` are equivalent:\n\n```rust\n#![allow(unused)]\nfn main() {\nstruct Addable;\nuse std::ops::AddAssign;\n\nimpl AddAssign<Addable> for Addable {\n    /* */\nfn add_assign(&mut self, other: Addable) {}\n}\n\nfn example() {\nlet (mut a1, a2) = (Addable, Addable);\n  a1 += a2;\n\nlet (mut a1, a2) = (Addable, Addable);\n  AddAssign::add_assign(&mut a1, a2);\n}\n}\n```\n\nLike assignment expressions, compound assignment expressions always produce [the unit value](../types/tuple.html).\n\nWarning: The evaluation order of operands swaps depending on the types of the operands: with primitive types the right-hand side will get evaluated first, while with non-primitive types the left-hand side will get evaluated first. Try not to write code that depends on the evaluation order of operands in compound assignment expressions. See [this test](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/1.58.0/src/test/ui/expr/compound-assignment/eval-order.rs) for an example of using this dependency.\n\n[ ](../expressions/block-expr.html \"Previous chapter\") [ ](../expressions/grouped-expr.html \"Next chapter\") "}
