Procedural macros come in one of three flavors:\n\n* [Function-like macros](#function-like-procedural-macros) \\- `custom!(...)`\n* [Derive macros](#derive-macros) \\- `#[derive(CustomDerive)]`\n* [Attribute macros](#attribute-macros) \\- `#[CustomAttribute]`\n\nProcedural macros allow you to run code at compile time that operates over Rust syntax, both consuming and producing Rust syntax. You can sort of think of procedural macros as functions from an AST to another AST.\n\nProcedural macros must be defined in a crate with the [crate type](linkage.html) of`proc-macro`.\n\n> **Note**: When using Cargo, Procedural macro crates are defined with the`proc-macro` key in your manifest:\n> \n> ```toml\n> [lib]\n> proc-macro = true\n> \n> ```\n\nAs functions, they must either return syntax, panic, or loop endlessly. Returned syntax either replaces or adds the syntax depending on the kind of procedural macro. Panics are caught by the compiler and are turned into a compiler error. Endless loops are not caught by the compiler which hangs the compiler.\n\nProcedural macros run during compilation, and thus have the same resources that the compiler has. For example, standard input, error, and output are the same that the compiler has access to. Similarly, file access is the same. Because of this, procedural macros have the same security concerns that [Cargo's build scripts](../cargo/reference/build-scripts.html) have.\n\nProcedural macros have two ways of reporting errors. The first is to panic. The second is to emit a [compile\\_error](../std/macro.compile%5Ferror.html) macro invocation.\n\n### [The proc\\_macro crate](#the-proc%5Fmacro-crate)\n\nProcedural macro crates almost always will link to the compiler-provided[proc\\_macro crate](../proc%5Fmacro/index.html). The `proc_macro` crate provides types required for writing procedural macros and facilities to make it easier.\n\nThis crate primarily contains a [TokenStream](../proc%5Fmacro/struct.TokenStream.html) type. Procedural macros operate over _token streams_ instead of AST nodes, which is a far more stable interface over time for both the compiler and for procedural macros to target. A_token stream_ is roughly equivalent to `Vec<TokenTree>` where a `TokenTree`can roughly be thought of as lexical token. For example `foo` is an `Ident`token, `.` is a `Punct` token, and `1.2` is a `Literal` token. The `TokenStream`type, unlike `Vec<TokenTree>`, is cheap to clone.\n\nAll tokens have an associated `Span`. A `Span` is an opaque value that cannot be modified but can be manufactured. `Span`s represent an extent of source code within a program and are primarily used for error reporting. While you cannot modify a `Span` itself, you can always change the `Span` _associated_with any token, such as through getting a `Span` from another token.\n\n### [Procedural macro hygiene](#procedural-macro-hygiene)\n\nProcedural macros are _unhygienic_. This means they behave as if the output token stream was simply written inline to the code it's next to. This means that it's affected by external items and also affects external imports.\n\nMacro authors need to be careful to ensure their macros work in as many contexts as possible given this limitation. This often includes using absolute paths to items in libraries (for example, `::std::option::Option` instead of `Option`) or by ensuring that generated functions have names that are unlikely to clash with other functions (like `__internal_foo` instead of `foo`).\n\n### [Function-like procedural macros](#function-like-procedural-macros)\n\n_Function-like procedural macros_ are procedural macros that are invoked using the macro invocation operator (`!`).\n\nThese macros are defined by a [public](visibility-and-privacy.html) [function](items/functions.html) with the `proc_macro` [attribute](attributes.html) and a signature of `(TokenStream) -> TokenStream`. The input[TokenStream](../proc%5Fmacro/struct.TokenStream.html) is what is inside the delimiters of the macro invocation and the output [TokenStream](../proc%5Fmacro/struct.TokenStream.html) replaces the entire macro invocation.\n\nFor example, the following macro definition ignores its input and outputs a function `answer` into its scope.\n\n```rust\n#![crate_type = \"proc-macro\"]\nextern crate proc_macro;\nuse proc_macro::TokenStream;\n\n#[proc_macro]\npub fn make_answer(_item: TokenStream) -> TokenStream {\n    \"fn answer() -> u32 { 42 }\".parse().unwrap()\n}\n```\n\nAnd then we use it in a binary crate to print \"42\" to standard output.\n\n```rust\nextern crate proc_macro_examples;\nuse proc_macro_examples::make_answer;\n\nmake_answer!();\n\nfn main() {\n    println!(\"{}\", answer());\n}\n```\n\nFunction-like procedural macros may be invoked in any macro invocation position, which includes [statements](statements.html), [expressions](expressions.html), [patterns](patterns.html), [type expressions](types.html#type-expressions), [item](items.html) positions, including items in [extern blocks](items/external-blocks.html), inherent and trait [implementations](items/implementations.html), and [trait definitions](items/traits.html).\n\n### [Derive macros](#derive-macros)\n\n_Derive macros_ define new inputs for the [derive attribute](attributes/derive.html). These macros can create new [items](items.html) given the token stream of a [struct](items/structs.html), [enum](items/enumerations.html), or [union](items/unions.html). They can also define [derive macro helper attributes](#derive-macro-helper-attributes).\n\nCustom derive macros are defined by a [public](visibility-and-privacy.html) [function](items/functions.html) with the`proc_macro_derive` attribute and a signature of `(TokenStream) -> TokenStream`.\n\nThe input [TokenStream](../proc%5Fmacro/struct.TokenStream.html) is the token stream of the item that has the `derive`attribute on it. The output [TokenStream](../proc%5Fmacro/struct.TokenStream.html) must be a set of items that are then appended to the [module](items/modules.html) or [block](expressions/block-expr.html) that the item from the input[TokenStream](../proc%5Fmacro/struct.TokenStream.html) is in.\n\nThe following is an example of a derive macro. Instead of doing anything useful with its input, it just appends a function `answer`.\n\n```rust\n#![crate_type = \"proc-macro\"]\nextern crate proc_macro;\nuse proc_macro::TokenStream;\n\n#[proc_macro_derive(AnswerFn)]\npub fn derive_answer_fn(_item: TokenStream) -> TokenStream {\n    \"fn answer() -> u32 { 42 }\".parse().unwrap()\n}\n```\n\nAnd then using said derive macro:\n\n```rust\nextern crate proc_macro_examples;\nuse proc_macro_examples::AnswerFn;\n\n#[derive(AnswerFn)]\nstruct Struct;\n\nfn main() {\n    assert_eq!(42, answer());\n}\n```\n\n#### [Derive macro helper attributes](#derive-macro-helper-attributes)\n\nDerive macros can add additional [attributes](attributes.html) into the scope of the [item](items.html)they are on. Said attributes are called _derive macro helper attributes_. These attributes are [inert](attributes.html#active-and-inert-attributes), and their only purpose is to be fed into the derive macro that defined them. That said, they can be seen by all macros.\n\nThe way to define helper attributes is to put an `attributes` key in the`proc_macro_derive` macro with a comma separated list of identifiers that are the names of the helper attributes.\n\nFor example, the following derive macro defines a helper attribute`helper`, but ultimately doesn't do anything with it.\n\n```rust\n#![crate_type=\"proc-macro\"]\nextern crate proc_macro;\nuse proc_macro::TokenStream;\n\n#[proc_macro_derive(HelperAttr, attributes(helper))]\npub fn derive_helper_attr(_item: TokenStream) -> TokenStream {\n    TokenStream::new()\n}\n```\n\nAnd then usage on the derive macro on a struct:\n\n```rust\n#[derive(HelperAttr)]\nstruct Struct {\n    #[helper] field: ()\n}\n```\n\n### [Attribute macros](#attribute-macros)\n\n_Attribute macros_ define new [outer attributes](attributes.html) which can be attached to [items](items.html), including items in [extern blocks](items/external-blocks.html), inherent and trait[implementations](items/implementations.html), and [trait definitions](items/traits.html).\n\nAttribute macros are defined by a [public](visibility-and-privacy.html) [function](items/functions.html) with the`proc_macro_attribute` [attribute](attributes.html) that has a signature of `(TokenStream, TokenStream) -> TokenStream`. The first [TokenStream](../proc%5Fmacro/struct.TokenStream.html) is the delimited token tree following the attribute's name, not including the outer delimiters. If the attribute is written as a bare attribute name, the attribute[TokenStream](../proc%5Fmacro/struct.TokenStream.html) is empty. The second [TokenStream](../proc%5Fmacro/struct.TokenStream.html) is the rest of the [item](items.html)including other [attributes](attributes.html) on the [item](items.html). The returned [TokenStream](../proc%5Fmacro/struct.TokenStream.html)replaces the [item](items.html) with an arbitrary number of [items](items.html).\n\nFor example, this attribute macro takes the input stream and returns it as is, effectively being the no-op of attributes.\n\n```rust\n#![crate_type = \"proc-macro\"]\nextern crate proc_macro;\nuse proc_macro::TokenStream;\n\n#[proc_macro_attribute]\npub fn return_as_is(_attr: TokenStream, item: TokenStream) -> TokenStream {\n    item\n}\n```\n\nThis following example shows the stringified [TokenStreams](../proc%5Fmacro/struct.TokenStream.html) that the attribute macros see. The output will show in the output of the compiler. The output is shown in the comments after the function prefixed with \"out:\".\n\n```rust\n// my-macro/src/lib.rs\nextern crate proc_macro;\nuse proc_macro::TokenStream;\n\n#[proc_macro_attribute]\npub fn show_streams(attr: TokenStream, item: TokenStream) -> TokenStream {\n    println!(\"attr: \\\"{}\\\"\", attr.to_string());\n    println!(\"item: \\\"{}\\\"\", item.to_string());\n    item\n}\n```\n\n```rust\n// src/lib.rs\nextern crate my_macro;\n\nuse my_macro::show_streams;\n\n// Example: Basic function\n#[show_streams]\nfn invoke1() {}\n// out: attr: \"\"\n// out: item: \"fn invoke1() { }\"\n\n// Example: Attribute with input\n#[show_streams(bar)]\nfn invoke2() {}\n// out: attr: \"bar\"\n// out: item: \"fn invoke2() {}\"\n\n// Example: Multiple tokens in the input\n#[show_streams(multiple => tokens)]\nfn invoke3() {}\n// out: attr: \"multiple => tokens\"\n// out: item: \"fn invoke3() {}\"\n\n// Example:\n#[show_streams { delimiters }]\nfn invoke4() {}\n// out: attr: \"delimiters\"\n// out: item: \"fn invoke4() {}\"\n```\n\n### [Declarative macro tokens and procedural macro tokens](#declarative-macro-tokens-and-procedural-macro-tokens)\n\nDeclarative `macro_rules` macros and procedural macros use similar, but different definitions for tokens (or rather [TokenTrees](../proc%5Fmacro/enum.TokenTree.html).)\n\nToken trees in `macro_rules` (corresponding to `tt` matchers) are defined as\n\n* Delimited groups (`(...)`, `{...}`, etc)\n* All operators supported by the language, both single-character and multi-character ones (`+`, `+=`).  \n   * Note that this set doesn't include the single quote `'`.\n* Literals (`\"string\"`, `1`, etc)  \n   * Note that negation (e.g. `-1`) is never a part of such literal tokens, but a separate operator token.\n* Identifiers, including keywords (`ident`, `r#ident`, `fn`)\n* Lifetimes (`'ident`)\n* Metavariable substitutions in `macro_rules` (e.g. `$my_expr` in`macro_rules! mac { ($my_expr: expr) => { $my_expr } }` after the `mac`'s expansion, which will be considered a single token tree regardless of the passed expression)\n\nToken trees in procedural macros are defined as\n\n* Delimited groups (`(...)`, `{...}`, etc)\n* All punctuation characters used in operators supported by the language (`+`, but not `+=`), and also the single quote `'` character (typically used in lifetimes, see below for lifetime splitting and joining behavior)\n* Literals (`\"string\"`, `1`, etc)  \n   * Negation (e.g. `-1`) is supported as a part of integer and floating point literals.\n* Identifiers, including keywords (`ident`, `r#ident`, `fn`)\n\nMismatches between these two definitions are accounted for when token streams are passed to and from procedural macros.   \nNote that the conversions below may happen lazily, so they might not happen if the tokens are not actually inspected.\n\nWhen passed to a proc-macro\n\n* All multi-character operators are broken into single characters.\n* Lifetimes are broken into a `'` character and an identifier.\n* All metavariable substitutions are represented as their underlying token streams.  \n   * Such token streams may be wrapped into delimited groups ([Group](../proc%5Fmacro/struct.Group.html)) with implicit delimiters ([Delimiter::None](../proc%5Fmacro/enum.Delimiter.html#variant.None)) when it's necessary for preserving parsing priorities.  \n   * `tt` and `ident` substitutions are never wrapped into such groups and always represented as their underlying token trees.\n\nWhen emitted from a proc macro\n\n* Punctuation characters are glued into multi-character operators when applicable.\n* Single quotes `'` joined with identifiers are glued into lifetimes.\n* Negative literals are converted into two tokens (the `-` and the literal) possibly wrapped into a delimited group ([Group](../proc%5Fmacro/struct.Group.html)) with implicit delimiters ([Delimiter::None](../proc%5Fmacro/enum.Delimiter.html#variant.None)) when it's necessary for preserving parsing priorities.\n\nNote that neither declarative nor procedural macros support doc comment tokens (e.g. `/// Doc`), so they are always converted to token streams representing their equivalent `#[doc = r\"str\"]` attributes when passed to macros.\n\n[ ](macros-by-example.html \"Previous chapter\") [ ](crates-and-source-files.html \"Next chapter\") "}
