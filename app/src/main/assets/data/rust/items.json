Items are organized within a crate by a nested set of [modules](items/modules.html). Every crate has a single \"outermost\" anonymous module; all further items within the crate have [paths](paths.html) within the module tree of the crate.\n\nItems are entirely determined at compile-time, generally remain fixed during execution, and may reside in read-only memory.\n\nThere are several kinds of items:\n\n* [modules](items/modules.html)\n* [extern crate declarations](items/extern-crates.html)\n* [use declarations](items/use-declarations.html)\n* [function definitions](items/functions.html)\n* [type definitions](items/type-aliases.html)\n* [struct definitions](items/structs.html)\n* [enumeration definitions](items/enumerations.html)\n* [union definitions](items/unions.html)\n* [constant items](items/constant-items.html)\n* [static items](items/static-items.html)\n* [trait definitions](items/traits.html)\n* [implementations](items/implementations.html)\n* [extern blocks](items/external-blocks.html)\n\nSome items form an implicit scope for the declaration of sub-items. In other words, within a function or module, declarations of items can (in many cases) be mixed with the statements, control blocks, and similar artifacts that otherwise compose the item body. The meaning of these scoped items is the same as if the item was declared outside the scope — it is still a static item — except that the item's _path name_ within the module namespace is qualified by the name of the enclosing item, or is private to the enclosing item (in the case of functions). The grammar specifies the exact locations in which sub-item declarations may appear.\n\n[ ](conditional-compilation.html \"Previous chapter\") [ ](items/modules.html \"Next chapter\") "}
