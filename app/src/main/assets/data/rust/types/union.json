Instead, every union access transmutes parts of the content of the union to the type of the accessed field. Since transmutes can cause unexpected or undefined behaviour, `unsafe` is required to read from a union field. Union field types are also restricted to a subset of types which ensures that they never need dropping. See the [item](../items/unions.html)documentation for further details.\n\nThe memory layout of a `union` is undefined by default (in particular, fields do_not_ have to be at offset 0), but the `#[repr(...)]` attribute can be used to fix a layout.\n\n[ ](../types/enum.html \"Previous chapter\") [ ](../types/function-item.html \"Next chapter\") "}
