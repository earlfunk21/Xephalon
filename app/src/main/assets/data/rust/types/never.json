Expressions of type `!` can be coerced into any other type.\n\n```rust\nlet x: ! = panic!();\n// Can be coerced into any type.\nlet y: u32 = x;\n```\n\n**NB.** The never type was expected to be stabilized in 1.41, but due to some last minute regressions detected the stabilization was temporarily reverted. The `!` type can only appear in function return types presently. See [the tracking issue](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/35121) for more details.\n\n[ ](../types/textual.html \"Previous chapter\") [ ](../types/tuple.html \"Next chapter\") "}
