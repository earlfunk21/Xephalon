This number of fields determines the _arity_ of the tuple. A tuple with `n` fields is called an _n-ary tuple_. For example, a tuple with 2 fields is a 2-ary tuple.\n\nFields of tuples are named using increasing numeric names matching their position in the list of types. The first field is `0`. The second field is `1`. And so on. The type of each field is the type of the same position in the tuple's list of types.\n\nFor convenience and historical reasons, the tuple type with no fields (`()`) is often called _unit_ or _the unit type_. Its one value is also called _unit_ or _the unit value_.\n\nSome examples of tuple types:\n\n* `()` (unit)\n* `(f64, f64)`\n* `(String, i32)`\n* `(i32, String)` (different type from the previous example)\n* `(i32, f64, Vec<String>, Option<bool>)`\n\nValues of this type are constructed using a [tuple expression](../expressions/tuple-expr.html#tuple-expressions). Furthermore, various expressions will produce the unit value if there is no other meaningful value for it to evaluate to. Tuple fields can be accessed by either a [tuple index expression](../expressions/tuple-expr.html#tuple-indexing-expressions) or [pattern matching](../patterns.html#tuple-patterns).\n\n1 \n\nStructural types are always equivalent if their internal types are equivalent. For a nominal version of tuples, see [tuple structs](./struct.html).\n\n[ ](../types/never.html \"Previous chapter\") [ ](../types/array.html \"Next chapter\") "}
