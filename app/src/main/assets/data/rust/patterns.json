They are also used in variable declarations and parameters for functions and closures.\n\nThe pattern in the following example does four things:\n\n* Tests if `person` has the `car` field filled with something.\n* Tests if the person's `age` field is between 13 and 19, and binds its value to the `person_age` variable.\n* Binds a reference to the `name` field to the variable `person_name`.\n* Ignores the rest of the fields of `person`. The remaining fields can have any value and are not bound to any variables.\n\n```rust\n#![allow(unused)]\nfn main() {\nstruct Car;\nstruct Computer;\nstruct Person {\n    name: String,\n    car: Option<Car>,\n    computer: Option<Computer>,\n    age: u8,\n}\nlet person = Person {\n    name: String::from(\"John\"),\n    car: Some(Car),\n    computer: None,\n    age: 15,\n};\nif let\n    Person {\n        car: Some(_),\n        age: person_age @ 13..=19,\n        name: ref person_name,\n        ..\n    } = person\n{\n    println!(\"{} has a car and is {} years old.\", person_name, person_age);\n}\n}\n```\n\nPatterns are used in:\n\n* [let declarations](statements.html#let-statements)\n* [Function](items/functions.html) and [closure](expressions/closure-expr.html) parameters\n* [match expressions](expressions/match-expr.html)\n* [if let expressions](expressions/if-expr.html)\n* [while let expressions](expressions/loop-expr.html#predicate-pattern-loops)\n* [for expressions](expressions/loop-expr.html#iterator-loops)\n\n## [Destructuring](#destructuring)\n\nPatterns can be used to _destructure_ [structs](items/structs.html), [enums](items/enumerations.html), and [tuples](types/tuple.html). Destructuring breaks up a value into its component pieces. The syntax used is almost the same as when creating such values. In a pattern whose [scrutinee](glossary.html#scrutinee) expression has a `struct`, `enum` or `tuple` type, a placeholder (`_`) stands in for a _single_ data field, whereas a wildcard `..` stands in for _all_ the remaining fields of a particular variant. When destructuring a data structure with named (but not numbered) fields, it is allowed to write `fieldname` as a shorthand for `fieldname: fieldname`.\n\n```rust\n#![allow(unused)]\nfn main() {\nenum Message {\n    Quit,\n    WriteString(String),\n    Move { x: i32, y: i32 },\n    ChangeColor(u8, u8, u8),\n}\nlet message = Message::Quit;\nmatch message {\n    Message::Quit => println!(\"Quit\"),\n    Message::WriteString(write) => println!(\"{}\", &write),\n    Message::Move{ x, y: 0 } => println!(\"move {} horizontally\", x),\n    Message::Move{ .. } => println!(\"other move\"),\n    Message::ChangeColor { 0: red, 1: green, 2: _ } => {\n        println!(\"color change, red: {}, green: {}\", red, green);\n    }\n};\n}\n```\n\n## [Refutability](#refutability)\n\nA pattern is said to be _refutable_ when it has the possibility of not being matched by the value it is being matched against._Irrefutable_ patterns, on the other hand, always match the value they are being matched against. Examples:\n\n```rust\n#![allow(unused)]\nfn main() {\nlet (x, y) = (1, 2);               // \"(x, y)\" is an irrefutable pattern\n\nif let (a, 3) = (1, 2) {           // \"(a, 3)\" is refutable, and will not match\n    panic!(\"Shouldn't reach here\");\n} else if let (a, 4) = (3, 4) {    // \"(a, 4)\" is refutable, and will match\n    println!(\"Matched ({}, 4)\", a);\n}\n}\n```\n\n## [Literal patterns](#literal-patterns)\n\n> **Syntax**  \n> _LiteralPattern_ :  \n> `true` | `false`  \n> | [CHAR\\_LITERAL](tokens.html#character-literals)  \n> | [BYTE\\_LITERAL](tokens.html#byte-literals)  \n> | [STRING\\_LITERAL](tokens.html#string-literals)  \n> | [RAW\\_STRING\\_LITERAL](tokens.html#raw-string-literals)  \n> | [BYTE\\_STRING\\_LITERAL](tokens.html#byte-string-literals)  \n> | [RAW\\_BYTE\\_STRING\\_LITERAL](tokens.html#raw-byte-string-literals)  \n> | `-`? [INTEGER\\_LITERAL](tokens.html#integer-literals)  \n> | `-`? [FLOAT\\_LITERAL](tokens.html#floating-point-literals)\n\n_Literal patterns_ match exactly the same value as what is created by the literal. Since negative numbers are not [literals](expressions/literal-expr.html), literal patterns also accept an optional minus sign before the literal, which acts like the negation operator.\n\nFloating-point literals are currently accepted, but due to the complexity of comparing them, they are going to be forbidden on literal patterns in a future version of Rust (see [issue #41620](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/41620)).\n\nLiteral patterns are always refutable.\n\nExamples:\n\n```rust\n#![allow(unused)]\nfn main() {\nfor i in -2..5 {\n    match i {\n        -1 => println!(\"It's minus one\"),\n        1 => println!(\"It's a one\"),\n        2|4 => println!(\"It's either a two or a four\"),\n        _ => println!(\"Matched none of the arms\"),\n    }\n}\n}\n```\n\n## [Identifier patterns](#identifier-patterns)\n\n> **Syntax**  \n> _IdentifierPattern_ :  \n> `ref`? `mut`? [IDENTIFIER](identifiers.html) (`@` [_PatternNoTopAlt_](#patterns) ) ?\n\nIdentifier patterns bind the value they match to a variable. The identifier must be unique within the pattern. The variable will shadow any variables of the same name in scope. The scope of the new binding depends on the context of where the pattern is used (such as a `let` binding or a `match` arm).\n\nPatterns that consist of only an identifier, possibly with a `mut`, match any value and bind it to that identifier. This is the most commonly used pattern in variable declarations and parameters for functions and closures.\n\n```rust\n#![allow(unused)]\nfn main() {\nlet mut variable = 10;\nfn sum(x: i32, y: i32) -> i32 {\n   x + y\n}\n}\n```\n\nTo bind the matched value of a pattern to a variable, use the syntax `variable @ subpattern`. For example, the following binds the value 2 to `e` (not the entire range: the range here is a range subpattern).\n\n```rust\n#![allow(unused)]\nfn main() {\nlet x = 2;\n\nmatch x {\n    e @ 1 ..= 5 => println!(\"got a range element {}\", e),\n    _ => println!(\"anything\"),\n}\n}\n```\n\nBy default, identifier patterns bind a variable to a copy of or move from the matched value depending on whether the matched value implements [Copy](special-types-and-traits.html#copy). This can be changed to bind to a reference by using the `ref` keyword, or to a mutable reference using `ref mut`. For example:\n\n```rust\n#![allow(unused)]\nfn main() {\nlet a = Some(10);\nmatch a {\n    None => (),\n    Some(value) => (),\n}\n\nmatch a {\n    None => (),\n    Some(ref value) => (),\n}\n}\n```\n\nIn the first match expression, the value is copied (or moved). In the second match, a reference to the same memory location is bound to the variable value. This syntax is needed because in destructuring subpatterns the `&` operator can't be applied to the value's fields. For example, the following is not valid:\n\n```rust\n#![allow(unused)]\nfn main() {\nstruct Person {\n   name: String,\n   age: u8,\n}\nlet value = Person { name: String::from(\"John\"), age: 23 };\nif let Person { name: &person_name, age: 18..=150 } = value { }\n}\n```\n\nTo make it valid, write the following:\n\n```rust\n#![allow(unused)]\nfn main() {\nstruct Person {\n   name: String,\n   age: u8,\n}\nlet value = Person { name: String::from(\"John\"), age: 23 };\nif let Person {name: ref person_name, age: 18..=150 } = value { }\n}\n```\n\nThus, `ref` is not something that is being matched against. Its objective is exclusively to make the matched binding a reference, instead of potentially copying or moving what was matched.\n\n[Path patterns](#path-patterns) take precedence over identifier patterns. It is an error if `ref` or `ref mut` is specified and the identifier shadows a constant.\n\nIdentifier patterns are irrefutable if the `@` subpattern is irrefutable or the subpattern is not specified.\n\n### [Binding modes](#binding-modes)\n\nTo service better ergonomics, patterns operate in different _binding modes_ in order to make it easier to bind references to values. When a reference value is matched by a non-reference pattern, it will be automatically treated as a `ref` or `ref mut` binding. Example:\n\n```rust\n#![allow(unused)]\nfn main() {\nlet x: &Option<i32> = &Some(3);\nif let Some(y) = x {\n    // y was converted to `ref y` and its type is &i32\n}\n}\n```\n\n_Non-reference patterns_ include all patterns except bindings, [wildcard patterns](#wildcard-pattern) (`_`), [const patterns](#path-patterns) of reference types, and [reference patterns](#reference-patterns).\n\nIf a binding pattern does not explicitly have `ref`, `ref mut`, or `mut`, then it uses the _default binding mode_ to determine how the variable is bound. The default binding mode starts in \"move\" mode which uses move semantics. When matching a pattern, the compiler starts from the outside of the pattern and works inwards. Each time a reference is matched using a non-reference pattern, it will automatically dereference the value and update the default binding mode. References will set the default binding mode to `ref`. Mutable references will set the mode to `ref mut` unless the mode is already `ref` in which case it remains `ref`. If the automatically dereferenced value is still a reference, it is dereferenced and this process repeats.\n\nMove bindings and reference bindings can be mixed together in the same pattern. Doing so will result in partial move of the object bound to and the object cannot be used afterwards. This applies only if the type cannot be copied.\n\nIn the example below, `name` is moved out of `person`. Trying to use `person` as a whole or `person.name` would result in an error because of _partial move_.\n\nExample:\n\n```rust\n#![allow(unused)]\nfn main() {\nstruct Person {\n   name: String,\n   age: u8,\n}\nlet person = Person{ name: String::from(\"John\"), age: 23 };\n// `name` is moved from person and `age` referenced\nlet Person { name, ref age } = person;\n}\n```\n\n## [Wildcard pattern](#wildcard-pattern)\n\n> **Syntax**  \n> _WildcardPattern_ :  \n> `_`\n\nThe _wildcard pattern_ (an underscore symbol) matches any value. It is used to ignore values when they don't matter. Inside other patterns it matches a single data field (as opposed to the `..` which matches the remaining fields). Unlike identifier patterns, it does not copy, move or borrow the value it matches.\n\nExamples:\n\n```rust\n#![allow(unused)]\nfn main() {\nlet x = 20;\nlet (a, _) = (10, x);   // the x is always matched by _\nassert_eq!(a, 10);\n\n// ignore a function/closure param\nlet real_part = |a: f64, _: f64| { a };\n\n// ignore a field from a struct\nstruct RGBA {\n   r: f32,\n   g: f32,\n   b: f32,\n   a: f32,\n}\nlet color = RGBA{r: 0.4, g: 0.1, b: 0.9, a: 0.5};\nlet RGBA{r: red, g: green, b: blue, a: _} = color;\nassert_eq!(color.r, red);\nassert_eq!(color.g, green);\nassert_eq!(color.b, blue);\n\n// accept any Some, with any value\nlet x = Some(10);\nif let Some(_) = x {}\n}\n```\n\nThe wildcard pattern is always irrefutable.\n\n## [Rest patterns](#rest-patterns)\n\n> **Syntax**  \n> _RestPattern_ :  \n> `..`\n\nThe _rest pattern_ (the `..` token) acts as a variable-length pattern which matches zero or more elements that haven't been matched already before and after. It may only be used in [tuple](#tuple-patterns), [tuple struct](#tuple-struct-patterns), and [slice](#slice-patterns) patterns, and may only appear once as one of the elements in those patterns. It is also allowed in an [identifier pattern](#identifier-patterns) for [slice patterns](#slice-patterns) only.\n\nThe rest pattern is always irrefutable.\n\nExamples:\n\n```rust\n#![allow(unused)]\nfn main() {\nlet words = vec![\"a\", \"b\", \"c\"];\nlet slice = &words[..];\nmatch slice {\n    [] => println!(\"slice is empty\"),\n    [one] => println!(\"single element {}\", one),\n    [head, tail @ ..] => println!(\"head={} tail={:?}\", head, tail),\n}\n\nmatch slice {\n    // Ignore everything but the last element, which must be \"!\".\n    [.., \"!\"] => println!(\"!!!\"),\n\n    // `start` is a slice of everything except the last element, which must be \"z\".\n    [start @ .., \"z\"] => println!(\"starts with: {:?}\", start),\n\n    // `end` is a slice of everything but the first element, which must be \"a\".\n    [\"a\", end @ ..] => println!(\"ends with: {:?}\", end),\n\n    // 'whole' is the entire slice and `last` is the final element\n    whole @ [.., last] => println!(\"the last element of {:?} is {}\", whole, last),\n\n    rest => println!(\"{:?}\", rest),\n}\n\nif let [.., penultimate, _] = slice {\n    println!(\"next to last is {}\", penultimate);\n}\n\nlet tuple = (1, 2, 3, 4, 5);\n// Rest patterns may also be used in tuple and tuple struct patterns.\nmatch tuple {\n    (1, .., y, z) => println!(\"y={} z={}\", y, z),\n    (.., 5) => println!(\"tail must be 5\"),\n    (..) => println!(\"matches everything else\"),\n}\n}\n```\n\n## [Range patterns](#range-patterns)\n\n> **Syntax**  \n> _RangePattern_ :  \n> _RangeInclusivePattern_  \n> | _RangeFromPattern_  \n> | _RangeToInclusivePattern_  \n> | _ObsoleteRangePattern_\n> \n> _RangeInclusivePattern_ :  \n> _RangePatternBound_ `..=` _RangePatternBound_\n> \n> _RangeFromPattern_ :  \n> _RangePatternBound_ `..`\n> \n> _RangeToInclusivePattern_ :  \n> `..=` _RangePatternBound_\n> \n> _ObsoleteRangePattern_ :  \n> _RangePatternBound_ `...` _RangePatternBound_\n> \n> _RangePatternBound_ :  \n> [CHAR\\_LITERAL](tokens.html#character-literals)  \n> | [BYTE\\_LITERAL](tokens.html#byte-literals)  \n> | `-`? [INTEGER\\_LITERAL](tokens.html#integer-literals)  \n> | `-`? [FLOAT\\_LITERAL](tokens.html#floating-point-literals)  \n> | [_PathExpression_](expressions/path-expr.html)\n\n_Range patterns_ match scalar values within the range defined by their bounds. They comprise a _sigil_ (one of `..`, `..=`, or `...`) and a bound on one or both sides. A bound on the left of the sigil is a _lower bound_. A bound on the right is an _upper bound_.\n\nA range pattern with both a lower and upper bound will match all values between and including both of its bounds. It is written as its lower bound, followed by `..=`, followed by its upper bound. The type of the range pattern is the type unification of its upper and lower bounds.\n\nFor example, a pattern `'m'..='p'` will match only the values `'m'`, `'n'`, `'o'`, and `'p'`.\n\nThe lower bound cannot be greater than the upper bound. That is, in `a..=b`, a ≤ b must be the case. For example, it is an error to have a range pattern `10..=0`.\n\nA range pattern with only a lower bound will match any value greater than or equal to the lower bound. It is written as its lower bound followed by `..`, and has the same type as its lower bound. For example, `1..` will match 1, 9, or 9001, or 9007199254740991 (if it is of an appropriate size), but not 0, and not negative numbers for signed integers.\n\nA range pattern with only an upper bound matches any value less than or equal to the upper bound. It is written as `..=` followed by its upper bound, and has the same type as its upper bound. For example, `..=10` will match 10, 1, 0, and for signed integer types, all negative values.\n\nRange patterns with only one bound cannot be used as the top-level pattern for subpatterns in [slice patterns](#slice-patterns).\n\nThe bounds is written as one of:\n\n* A character, byte, integer, or float literal.\n* A `-` followed by an integer or float literal.\n* A [path](expressions/path-expr.html)\n\nIf the bounds is written as a path, after macro resolution, the path must resolve to a constant item of the type `char`, an integer type, or a float type.\n\nThe type and value of the bounds is dependent upon how it is written out. If the bounds is a [path](expressions/path-expr.html), the pattern has the type and value of the [constant](items/constant-items.html) the path resolves to. If it is a literal, it has the type and value of the corresponding [literal expression](expressions/literal-expr.html). If is a literal preceded by a `-`, it has the same type as the corresponding [literal expression](expressions/literal-expr.html) and the value of [negating](expressions/operator-expr.html#negation-operators) the value of the corresponding literal expression.\n\nExamples:\n\n```rust\n#![allow(unused)]\nfn main() {\nlet c = 'f';\nlet valid_variable = match c {\n    'a'..='z' => true,\n    'A'..='Z' => true,\n    'α'..='ω' => true,\n    _ => false,\n};\n\nlet ph = 10;\nprintln!(\"{}\", match ph {\n    0..=6 => \"acid\",\n    7 => \"neutral\",\n    8..=14 => \"base\",\n    _ => unreachable!(),\n});\n\nlet uint: u32 = 5;\nmatch uint {\n    0 => \"zero!\",\n    1.. => \"positive number!\",\n};\n\n// using paths to constants:\nconst TROPOSPHERE_MIN : u8 = 6;\nconst TROPOSPHERE_MAX : u8 = 20;\n\nconst STRATOSPHERE_MIN : u8 = TROPOSPHERE_MAX + 1;\nconst STRATOSPHERE_MAX : u8 = 50;\n\nconst MESOSPHERE_MIN : u8 = STRATOSPHERE_MAX + 1;\nconst MESOSPHERE_MAX : u8 = 85;\n\nlet altitude = 70;\n\nprintln!(\"{}\", match altitude {\n    TROPOSPHERE_MIN..=TROPOSPHERE_MAX => \"troposphere\",\n    STRATOSPHERE_MIN..=STRATOSPHERE_MAX => \"stratosphere\",\n    MESOSPHERE_MIN..=MESOSPHERE_MAX => \"mesosphere\",\n    _ => \"outer space, maybe\",\n});\n\npub mod binary {\n    pub const MEGA : u64 = 1024*1024;\n    pub const GIGA : u64 = 1024*1024*1024;\n}\nlet n_items = 20_832_425;\nlet bytes_per_item = 12;\nif let size @ binary::MEGA..=binary::GIGA = n_items * bytes_per_item {\n    println!(\"It fits and occupies {} bytes\", size);\n}\n\ntrait MaxValue {\n    const MAX: u64;\n}\nimpl MaxValue for u8 {\n    const MAX: u64 = (1 << 8) - 1;\n}\nimpl MaxValue for u16 {\n    const MAX: u64 = (1 << 16) - 1;\n}\nimpl MaxValue for u32 {\n    const MAX: u64 = (1 << 32) - 1;\n}\n// using qualified paths:\nprintln!(\"{}\", match 0xfacade {\n    0 ..= <u8 as MaxValue>::MAX => \"fits in a u8\",\n    0 ..= <u16 as MaxValue>::MAX => \"fits in a u16\",\n    0 ..= <u32 as MaxValue>::MAX => \"fits in a u32\",\n    _ => \"too big\",\n});\n}\n```\n\nRange patterns for fix-width integer and `char` types are irrefutable when they span the entire set of possible values of a type. For example, `0u8..=255u8` is irrefutable. The range of values for an integer type is the closed range from its minimum to maximum value. The range of values for a `char` type are precisely those ranges containing all Unicode Scalar Values: `'\\u{0000}'..='\\u{D7FF}'` and `'\\u{E000}'..='\\u{10FFFF}'`.\n\nFloating point range patterns are deprecated and may be removed in a future Rust release. See [issue #41620](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/41620) for more information.\n\n> **Edition Differences**: Before the 2021 edition, range patterns with both a lower and upper bound may also be written using `...` in place of `..=`, with the same meaning.\n\n> **Note**: Although range patterns use the same syntax as [range expressions](expressions/range-expr.html), there are no exclusive range patterns. That is, neither `x .. y` nor `.. x` are valid range patterns.\n\n## [Reference patterns](#reference-patterns)\n\n> **Syntax**  \n> _ReferencePattern_ :  \n> (`&`|`&&`) `mut`? [_PatternWithoutRange_](#patterns)\n\nReference patterns dereference the pointers that are being matched and, thus, borrow them.\n\nFor example, these two matches on `x: &i32` are equivalent:\n\n```rust\n#![allow(unused)]\nfn main() {\nlet int_reference = &3;\n\nlet a = match *int_reference { 0 => \"zero\", _ => \"some\" };\nlet b = match int_reference { &0 => \"zero\", _ => \"some\" };\n\nassert_eq!(a, b);\n}\n```\n\nThe grammar production for reference patterns has to match the token `&&` to match a reference to a reference because it is a token by itself, not two `&` tokens.\n\nAdding the `mut` keyword dereferences a mutable reference. The mutability must match the mutability of the reference.\n\nReference patterns are always irrefutable.\n\n## [Struct patterns](#struct-patterns)\n\n> **Syntax**  \n> _StructPattern_ :  \n> [_PathInExpression_](paths.html#paths-in-expressions) `{`  \n> _StructPatternElements_ ?  \n> `}`\n> \n> _StructPatternElements_ :  \n> _StructPatternFields_ (`,` | `,` _StructPatternEtCetera_)?  \n> | _StructPatternEtCetera_\n> \n> _StructPatternFields_ :  \n> _StructPatternField_ (`,` _StructPatternField_) \\*\n> \n> _StructPatternField_ :  \n> [_OuterAttribute_](attributes.html) \\*  \n> (  \n> [TUPLE\\_INDEX](tokens.html#tuple-index) `:` [_Pattern_](#patterns)  \n> | [IDENTIFIER](identifiers.html) `:` [_Pattern_](#patterns)  \n> | `ref`? `mut`?

They are also used to [destructure](#destructuring) a struct.\n\nOn a struct pattern, the fields are referenced by name, index (in the case of tuple structs) or ignored by use of `..`:\n\n```rust\n#![allow(unused)]\nfn main() {\nstruct Point {\n    x: u32,\n    y: u32,\n}\nlet s = Point {x: 1, y: 1};\n\nmatch s {\n    Point {x: 10, y: 20} => (),\n    Point {y: 10, x: 20} => (),    // order doesn't matter\n    Point {x: 10, ..} => (),\n    Point {..} => (),\n}\n\nstruct PointTuple (\n    u32,\n    u32,\n);\nlet t = PointTuple(1, 2);\n\nmatch t {\n    PointTuple {0: 10, 1: 20} => (),\n    PointTuple {1: 10, 0: 20} => (),   // order doesn't matter\n    PointTuple {0: 10, ..} => (),\n    PointTuple {..} => (),\n}\n}\n```\n\nIf `..` is not used, it is required to match all fields:\n\n```rust\n#![allow(unused)]\nfn main() {\nstruct Struct {\n   a: i32,\n   b: char,\n   c: bool,\n}\nlet mut struct_value = Struct{a: 10, b: 'X', c: false};\n\nmatch struct_value {\n    Struct{a: 10, b: 'X', c: false} => (),\n    Struct{a: 10, b: 'X', ref c} => (),\n    Struct{a: 10, b: 'X', ref mut c} => (),\n    Struct{a: 10, b: 'X', c: _} => (),\n    Struct{a: _, b: _, c: _} => (),\n}\n}\n```\n\nThe `ref` and/or `mut` _IDENTIFIER_ syntax matches any value and binds it to a variable with the same name as the given field.\n\n```rust\n#![allow(unused)]\nfn main() {\nstruct Struct {\n   a: i32,\n   b: char,\n   c: bool,\n}\nlet struct_value = Struct{a: 10, b: 'X', c: false};\n\nlet Struct{a: x, b: y, c: z} = struct_value;          // destructure all fields\n}\n```\n\nA struct pattern is refutable when one of its subpatterns is refutable.\n\n## [Tuple struct patterns](#tuple-struct-patterns)\n\n> **Syntax**  \n> _TupleStructPattern_ :  \n> [_PathInExpression_](paths.html#paths-in-expressions) `(` _TupleStructItems_? `)`\n> \n> _TupleStructItems_ :  \n> [_Pattern_](#patterns) ( `,` [_Pattern_](#patterns) )\\* `,`?\n\nTuple struct patterns match tuple struct and enum values that match all criteria defined by its subpatterns.

They are also used to [destructure](#destructuring) a tuple.\n\nThe form `(..)` with a single [_RestPattern_](#rest-patterns) is a special form that does not require a comma, and matches a tuple of any size.\n\nThe tuple pattern is refutable when one of its subpatterns is refutable.\n\nAn example of using tuple patterns:\n\n```rust\n#![allow(unused)]\nfn main() {\nlet pair = (10, \"ten\");\nlet (a, b) = pair;\n\nassert_eq!(a, 10);\nassert_eq!(b, \"ten\");\n}\n```\n\n## [Grouped patterns](#grouped-patterns)\n\n> **Syntax**  \n> _GroupedPattern_ :  \n> `(` [_Pattern_](#patterns) `)`\n\nEnclosing a pattern in parentheses can be used to explicitly control the precedence of compound patterns. For example, a reference pattern next to a range pattern such as `&0..=5` is ambiguous and is not allowed, but can be expressed with parentheses.\n\n```rust\n#![allow(unused)]\nfn main() {\nlet int_reference = &3;\nmatch int_reference {\n    &(0..=5) => (),\n    _ => (),\n}\n}\n```\n\n## [Slice patterns](#slice-patterns)\n\n> **Syntax**  \n> _SlicePattern_ :  \n> `[` _SlicePatternItems_? `]`\n> \n> _SlicePatternItems_ :  \n> [_Pattern_](#patterns) (`,` [_Pattern_](#patterns))\\* `,`?\n\nSlice patterns can match both arrays of fixed size and slices of dynamic size.\n\n```rust\n#![allow(unused)]\nfn main() {\n// Fixed size\nlet arr = [1, 2, 3];\nmatch arr {\n    [1, _, _] => \"starts with one\",\n    [a, b, c] => \"starts with something else\",\n};\n}\n```\n\n```rust\n#![allow(unused)]\nfn main() {\n// Dynamic size\nlet v = vec![1, 2, 3];\nmatch v[..] {\n    [a, b] => { /* this arm will not apply because the length doesn't match */ }\n    [a, b, c] => { /* this arm will apply */ }\n    _ => { /* this wildcard is required, since the length is not known statically */ }\n};\n}\n```\n\nSlice patterns are irrefutable when matching an array as long as each element is irrefutable. When matching a slice, it is irrefutable only in the form with a single `..` [rest pattern](#rest-patterns) or [identifier pattern](#identifier-patterns) with the `..` rest pattern as a subpattern.\n\nWithin a slice, a range pattern without both lower and upper bound must be enclosed in parentheses, as in `(a..)`, to clarify it is intended to match against a single slice element. A range pattern with both lower and upper bound, like `a..=b`, is not required to be enclosed in parentheses.\n\n## [Path patterns](#path-patterns)\n\n> **Syntax**  \n> _PathPattern_ :  \n> [_PathExpression_](expressions/path-expr.html)\n\n_Path patterns_ are patterns that refer either to constant values or to structs or enum variants that have no fields.\n\nUnqualified path patterns can refer to:\n\n* enum variants\n* structs\n* constants\n* associated constants\n\nQualified path patterns can only refer to associated constants.\n\nConstants cannot be a union type. Struct and enum constants must have `#[derive(PartialEq, Eq)]` (not merely implemented).\n\nPath patterns are irrefutable when they refer to structs or an enum variant when the enum has only one variant or a constant whose type is irrefutable. They are refutable when they refer to refutable constants or enum variants for enums with multiple variants.\n\n## [Or-patterns](#or-patterns)\n\n_Or-patterns_ are patterns that match on one of two or more sub-patterns (for example `A | B | C`). They can nest arbitrarily. Syntactically, or-patterns are allowed in any of the places where other patterns are allowed (represented by the _Pattern_ production), with the exceptions of `let`\\-bindings and function and closure arguments (represented by the _PatternNoTopAlt_ production).\n\n### [Static semantics](#static-semantics)\n\n1. Given a pattern `p | q` at some depth for some arbitrary patterns `p` and `q`, the pattern is considered ill-formed if:  \n   * the type inferred for `p` does not unify with the type inferred for `q`, or  \n   * the same set of bindings are not introduced in `p` and `q`, or  \n   * the type of any two bindings with the same name in `p` and `q` do not unify with respect to types or binding modes.  \nUnification of types is in all instances aforementioned exact and implicit [type coercions](type-coercions.html) do not apply.\n2. When type checking an expression `match e_s { a_1 => e_1, ... a_n => e_n }`, for each match arm `a_i` which contains a pattern of form `p_i | q_i`, the pattern `p_i | q_i` is considered ill formed if, at the depth `d` where it exists the fragment of `e_s` at depth `d`, the type of the expression fragment does not unify with `p_i | q_i`.\n3. With respect to exhaustiveness checking, a pattern `p | q` is considered to cover `p` as well as `q`. For some constructor `c(x, ..)` the distributive law applies such that `c(p | q, ..rest)` covers the same set of value as `c(p, ..rest) | c(q, ..rest)` does. This can be applied recursively until there are no more nested patterns of form `p | q` other than those that exist at the top level.  \nNote that by _\"constructor\"_ we do not refer to tuple struct patterns, but rather we refer to a pattern for any product type. This includes enum variants, tuple structs, structs with named fields, arrays, tuples, and slices.\n\n### [Dynamic semantics](#dynamic-semantics)\n\n1. The dynamic semantics of pattern matching a scrutinee expression `e_s` against a pattern `c(p | q, ..rest)` at depth `d` where `c` is some constructor,`p` and `q` are arbitrary patterns, and `rest` is optionally any remaining potential factors in `c`, is defined as being the same as that of `c(p, ..rest) | c(q, ..rest)`.\n\n### [Precedence with other undelimited patterns](#precedence-with-other-undelimited-patterns)\n\nAs shown elsewhere in this chapter, there are several types of patterns that are syntactically undelimited, including identifier patterns, reference patterns, and or-patterns. Or-patterns always have the lowest-precedence. This allows us to reserve syntactic space for a possible future type ascription feature and also to reduce ambiguity. For example, `x @ A(..) | B(..)` will result in an error that `x` is not bound in all patterns.`&A(x) | B(x)` will result in a type mismatch between `x` in the different subpatterns.\n\n[ ](expressions/underscore-expr.html \"Previous chapter\") [ ](type-system.html \"Next chapter\") "}
