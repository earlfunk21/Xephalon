This includes code within `unsafe` blocks and `unsafe` functions.`unsafe` only means that avoiding undefined behavior is on the programmer; it does not change anything about the fact that Rust programs must never cause undefined behavior.\n\nIt is the programmer's responsibility when writing `unsafe` code to ensure that any safe code interacting with the `unsafe` code cannot trigger these behaviors. `unsafe` code that satisfies this property for any safe client is called _sound_; if `unsafe` code can be misused by safe code to exhibit undefined behavior, it is _unsound_.\n\n_**Warning:**_ The following list is not exhaustive. There is no formal model of Rust's semantics for what is and is not allowed in unsafe code, so there may be more behavior considered unsafe. The following list is just what we know for sure is undefined behavior. Please read the [Rustonomicon](../nomicon/index.html) before writing unsafe code.\n\n* Data races.\n* Evaluating a [dereference expression](expressions/operator-expr.html#the-dereference-operator) (`*expr`) on a raw pointer that is[dangling](#dangling-pointers) or unaligned, even in [place expression context](expressions.html#place-expressions-and-value-expressions)(e.g. `addr_of!(*expr)`).\n* Breaking the [pointer aliasing rules](http://llvm.org/docs/LangRef.html#pointer-aliasing-rules). `Box<T>`, `&mut T` and `&T` follow LLVMâ€™s scoped [noalias](http://llvm.org/docs/LangRef.html#noalias) model, except if the `&T` contains an[UnsafeCell<U>](../std/cell/struct.UnsafeCell.html). References and boxes must not be [dangling](#dangling-pointers) while they are live. The exact liveness duration is not specified, but some bounds exist:  \n   * For references, the liveness duration is upper-bounded by the syntactic lifetime assigned by the borrow checker; it cannot be live any _longer_ than that lifetime.  \n   * Each time a reference or box is passed to or returned from a function, it is considered live.  \n   * When a reference (but not a `Box`!) is passed to a function, it is live at least as long as that function call, again except if the `&T` contains an[UnsafeCell<U>](../std/cell/struct.UnsafeCell.html).  \nAll this also applies when values of these types are passed in a (nested) field of a compound type, but not behind pointer indirections.\n* Mutating immutable data. All data inside a [const](items/constant-items.html) item is immutable. Moreover, all data reached through a shared reference or data owned by an immutable binding is immutable, unless that data is contained within an [UnsafeCell<U>](../std/cell/struct.UnsafeCell.html).\n* Invoking undefined behavior via compiler intrinsics.\n* Executing code compiled with platform features that the current platform does not support (see [target\\_feature](attributes/codegen.html#the-target%5Ffeature-attribute)), _except_ if the platform explicitly documents this to be safe.\n* Calling a function with the wrong call ABI or unwinding from a function with the wrong unwind ABI.\n* Producing an invalid value, even in private fields and locals. \"Producing\" a value happens any time a value is assigned to or read from a place, passed to a function/primitive operation or returned from a function/primitive operation. The following values are invalid (at their respective type):  \n   * A value other than `false` (`0`) or `true` (`1`) in a [bool](types/boolean.html).  \n   * A discriminant in an `enum` not included in the type definition.  \n   * A null `fn` pointer.  \n   * A value in a `char` which is a surrogate or above `char::MAX`.  \n   * A `!` (all values are invalid for this type).  \n   * An integer (`i*`/`u*`), floating point value (`f*`), or raw pointer obtained from [uninitialized memory](http://llvm.org/docs/LangRef.html#undefined-values), or uninitialized memory in a `str`.  \n   * A reference or `Box<T>` that is [dangling](#dangling-pointers), unaligned, or points to an invalid value.  \n   * Invalid metadata in a wide reference, `Box<T>`, or raw pointer:  \n         * `dyn Trait` metadata is invalid if it is not a pointer to a vtable for`Trait` that matches the actual dynamic trait the pointer or reference points to.  \n         * Slice metadata is invalid if the length is not a valid `usize`(i.e., it must not be read from uninitialized memory).  \n   * Invalid values for a type with a custom definition of invalid values. In the standard library, this affects [NonNull<T>](../core/ptr/struct.NonNull.html) and [NonZero\\*](../core/num/index.html).  \n   > **Note**: `rustc` achieves this with the unstable`rustc_layout_scalar_valid_range_*` attributes.\n* Incorrect use of inline assembly. For more details, refer to the [rules](inline-assembly.html#rules-for-inline-assembly) to follow when writing code that uses inline assembly.\n\n**Note:** Uninitialized memory is also implicitly invalid for any type that has a restricted set of valid values. In other words, the only cases in which reading uninitialized memory is permitted are inside `union`s and in \"padding\" (the gaps between the fields/elements of a type).\n\n> **Note**: Undefined behavior affects the entire program. For example, calling a function in C that exhibits undefined behavior of C means your entire program contains undefined behaviour that can also affect the Rust code. And vice versa, undefined behavior in Rust can cause adverse affects on code executed by any FFI calls to other languages.\n\n### [Dangling pointers](#dangling-pointers)\n\nA reference/pointer is \"dangling\" if it is null or not all of the bytes it points to are part of the same live allocation (so in particular they all have to be part of _some_ allocation). The span of bytes it points to is determined by the pointer value and the size of the pointee type (using `size_of_val`).\n\nIf the size is 0, then the pointer must either point inside of a live allocation (including pointing just after the last byte of the allocation), or it must be directly constructed from a non-zero integer literal.\n\nNote that dynamically sized types (such as slices and strings) point to their entire range, so it is important that the length metadata is never too large. In particular, the dynamic size of a Rust value (as determined by `size_of_val`) must never exceed `isize::MAX`.\n\n[ ](unsafe-keyword.html \"Previous chapter\") [ ](behavior-not-considered-unsafe.html \"Next chapter\") "}
