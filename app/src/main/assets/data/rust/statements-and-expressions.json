This means that most forms of value-producing or effect-causing evaluation are directed by the uniform syntax category of _expressions_. Each kind of expression can typically _nest_ within each other kind of expression, and rules for evaluation of expressions involve specifying both the value produced by the expression and the order in which its sub-expressions are themselves evaluated.\n\nIn contrast, statements serve _mostly_ to contain and explicitly sequence expression evaluation.\n\n[ ](attributes/type%5Fsystem.html \"Previous chapter\") [ ](statements.html \"Next chapter\") "}
