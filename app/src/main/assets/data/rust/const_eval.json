Only a subset of all expressions can be evaluated at compile-time.\n\n## [Constant expressions](#constant-expressions)\n\nCertain forms of expressions, called constant expressions, can be evaluated at compile time. In [const contexts](#const-context), these are the only allowed expressions, and are always evaluated at compile time. In other places, such as[let statements](statements.html#let-statements), constant expressions _may_be, but are not guaranteed to be, evaluated at compile time. Behaviors such as out of bounds [array indexing](expressions/array-expr.html#array-and-slice-indexing-expressions) or [overflow](expressions/operator-expr.html#overflow) are compiler errors if the value must be evaluated at compile time (i.e. in const contexts). Otherwise, these behaviors are warnings, but will likely panic at run-time.\n\nThe following expressions are constant expressions, so long as any operands are also constant expressions and do not cause any [Drop::drop](destructors.html) calls to be run.\n\n* [Literals](expressions/literal-expr.html).\n* [Const parameters](items/generics.html).\n* [Paths](expressions/path-expr.html) to [functions](items/functions.html) and [constants](items/constant-items.html). Recursively defining constants is not allowed.\n* Paths to [statics](items/static-items.html). These are only allowed within the initializer of a static.\n* [Tuple expressions](expressions/tuple-expr.html).\n* [Array expressions](expressions/array-expr.html).\n* [Struct](expressions/struct-expr.html) expressions.\n* [Block expressions](expressions/block-expr.html), including `unsafe` blocks.  \n   * [let statements](statements.html#let-statements) and thus irrefutable [patterns](patterns.html), including mutable bindings  \n   * [assignment expressions](expressions/operator-expr.html#assignment-expressions)  \n   * [compound assignment expressions](expressions/operator-expr.html#compound-assignment-expressions)  \n   * [expression statements](statements.html#expression-statements)\n* [Field](expressions/field-expr.html) expressions.\n* Index expressions, [array indexing](expressions/array-expr.html#array-and-slice-indexing-expressions) or [slice](types/slice.html) with a `usize`.\n* [Range expressions](expressions/range-expr.html).\n* [Closure expressions](expressions/closure-expr.html) which don't capture variables from the environment.\n* Built-in [negation](expressions/operator-expr.html#negation-operators), [arithmetic](expressions/operator-expr.html#arithmetic-and-logical-binary-operators), [logical](expressions/operator-expr.html#arithmetic-and-logical-binary-operators), [comparison](expressions/operator-expr.html#comparison-operators) or [lazy boolean](expressions/operator-expr.html#lazy-boolean-operators)operators used on integer and floating point types, `bool`, and `char`.\n* Shared [borrow](expressions/operator-expr.html#borrow-operators)s, except if applied to a type with [interior mutability](interior-mutability.html).\n* The [dereference operator](expressions/operator-expr.html#the-dereference-operator) except for raw pointers.\n* [Grouped](expressions/grouped-expr.html) expressions.\n* [Cast](expressions/operator-expr.html#type-cast-expressions) expressions, except  \n   * pointer to address casts and  \n   * function pointer to address casts.\n* Calls of [const functions](items/functions.html#const-functions) and const methods.\n* [loop](expressions/loop-expr.html#infinite-loops), [while](expressions/loop-expr.html#predicate-loops) and [while let](expressions/loop-expr.html#predicate-pattern-loops) expressions.\n* [if](expressions/if-expr.html#if-expressions), [if let](expressions/if-expr.html#if-let-expressions) and [match](expressions/match-expr.html) expressions.\n\n## [Const context](#const-context)\n\nA _const context_ is one of the following:\n\n* [Array type length expressions](types/array.html)\n* [Array repeat length expressions](expressions/array-expr.html)\n* The initializer of  \n   * [constants](items/constant-items.html)  \n   * [statics](items/static-items.html)  \n   * [enum discriminants](items/enumerations.html#discriminants)\n* A [const generic argument](items/generics.html#const-generics)\n\n## [Const Functions](#const-functions)\n\nA _const fn_ is a function that one is permitted to call from a const context. Declaring a function`const` has no effect on any existing uses, it only restricts the types that arguments and the return type may use, as well as prevent various expressions from being used within it. You can freely do anything with a const function that you can do with a regular function.\n\nWhen called from a const context, the function is interpreted by the compiler at compile time. The interpretation happens in the environment of the compilation target and not the host. So `usize` is`32` bits if you are compiling against a `32` bit system, irrelevant of whether you are building on a `64` bit or a `32` bit system.\n\nConst functions have various restrictions to make sure that they can be evaluated at compile-time. It is, for example, not possible to write a random number generator as a const function. Calling a const function at compile-time will always yield the same result as calling it at runtime, even when called multiple times. There's one exception to this rule: if you are doing complex floating point operations in extreme situations, then you might get (very slightly) different results. It is advisable to not make array lengths and enum discriminants depend on floating point computations.\n\nNotable features that are allowed in const contexts but not in const functions include:\n\n* floating point operations  \n   * floating point values are treated just like generic parameters without trait bounds beyond`Copy`. So you cannot do anything with them but copy/move them around.\n\nConversely, the following are possible in a const function, but not in a const context:\n\n* Use of generic type and lifetime parameters.  \n   * Const contexts do allow limited use of [const generic parameters](items/generics.html#const-generics).\n\n[ ](behavior-not-considered-unsafe.html \"Previous chapter\") [ ](abi.html \"Next chapter\") "}
