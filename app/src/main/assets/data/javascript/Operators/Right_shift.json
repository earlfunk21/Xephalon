Excess bits shifted off to the right are discarded, and copies of the leftmost bit are shifted in from the left. This operation is also called \"sign-propagating right shift\" or \"arithmetic right shift\", because the sign of the resulting number is the same as the sign of the first operand.\n\n## [Try it](#try%5Fit)\n\n## [Syntax](#syntax)\n\n```\nx >> y\n\n```\n\n## [Description](#description)\n\nThe `>>` operator is overloaded for two types of operands: number and [BigInt](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global%5FObjects/BigInt). For numbers, the operator returns a 32-bit integer. For BigInts, the operator returns a BigInt. It first [coerces both operands to numeric values](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Data%5Fstructures#numeric%5Fcoercion) and tests the types of them. It performs BigInt right shift if both operands becomes BigInts; otherwise, it converts both operands to [32-bit integers](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global%5FObjects/Number#fixed-width%5Fnumber%5Fconversion) and performs number right shift. A [TypeError](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global%5FObjects/TypeError) is thrown if one operand becomes a BigInt but the other becomes a number.\n\nSince the new leftmost bit has the same value as the previous leftmost bit, the sign bit (the leftmost bit) does not change. Hence the name \"sign-propagating\".\n\nThe operator operates on the left operand's bit representation in [two's complement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two's%5Fcomplement). Consider the 32-bit binary representations of the decimal (base 10) numbers `9` and `-9`:\n\n     9 (base 10): 00000000000000000000000000001001 (base 2)\n    -9 (base 10): 11111111111111111111111111110111 (base 2)\n\nThe binary representation under two's complement of the negative decimal (base 10) number `-9` is formed by inverting all the bits of its opposite number, which is `9` and `00000000000000000000000000001001` in binary, and adding `1`.\n\nIn both cases, the sign of the binary number is given by its leftmost bit: for the positive decimal number `9`, the leftmost bit of the binary representation is `0`, and for the negative decimal number `-9`, the leftmost bit of the binary representation is `1`.\n\nGiven those binary representations of the decimal (base 10) numbers `9`, and `-9`:\n\n`9 >> 2` yields 2:\n\n     9 (base 10): 00000000000000000000000000001001 (base 2)\n                  --------------------------------\n9 >> 2 (base 10): 00000000000000000000000000000010 (base 2) = 2 (base 10)\n\nNotice how two rightmost bits, `01`, have been shifted off, and two copies of the leftmost bit, `0` have been shifted in from the left.\n\n`-9 >> 2` yields `-3`:\n\n     -9 (base 10): 11111111111111111111111111110111 (base 2)\n                   --------------------------------\n-9 >> 2 (base 10): 11111111111111111111111111111101 (base 2) = -3 (base 10)\n\nNotice how two rightmost bits, `11`, have been shifted off. But as far as the leftmost bits: in this case, the leftmost bit is `1`. So two copies of that leftmost `1` bit have been shifted in from the left â€” which preserves the negative sign.\n\nThe binary representation `11111111111111111111111111111101` is equal to the negative decimal (base 10) number `-3`, because all negative integers are stored as [two's complements](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two's%5Fcomplement), and this one can be calculated by inverting all the bits of the binary representation of the positive decimal (base 10) number `3`, which is `00000000000000000000000000000011`, and then adding one.\n\nIf the left operand is a number with more than 32 bits, it will get the most significant bits discarded. For example, the following integer with more than 32 bits will be converted to a 32-bit integer:\n\nBefore: 11100110111110100000000000000110000000000001\nAfter:              10100000000000000110000000000001\n\nThe right operand will be converted to an unsigned 32-bit integer and then taken modulo 32, so the actual shift offset will always be a positive integer between 0 and 31, inclusive. For example, `100 >> 32` is the same as `100 >> 0` (and produces `100`) because 32 modulo 32 is 0.\n\nFor BigInts, there's no truncation. Conceptually, understand positive BigInts as having an infinite number of leading `0` bits, and negative BigInts having an infinite number of leading `1` bits.\n\nRight shifting any number `x` by `0` returns `x` converted to a 32-bit integer. Do not use `>> 0` to truncate numbers to integers; use [Math.trunc()](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global%5FObjects/Math/trunc#using%5Fbitwise%5Fno-ops%5Fto%5Ftruncate%5Fnumbers) instead.\n\n## [Examples](#examples)\n\n### [Using right shift](#using%5Fright%5Fshift)\n\n```\n9 >> 2; // 2\n-9 >> 2; // -3\n\n9n >> 2n; // 2n\n\n```\n\n## [Specifications](#specifications)\n\n| Specification                                                                                                                                                                   |\n| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| [ECMAScript Language Specification  \\# sec-signed-right-shift-operator](https://tc39.es/ecma262/multipage/ecmascript-language-expressions.html#sec-signed-right-shift-operator) |\n\n## [Browser compatibility](#browser%5Fcompatibility)\n\nBCD tables only load in the browser\n\n## [See also](#see%5Falso)\n\n* [Bitwise operators in the JS guide](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Expressions%5Fand%5Foperators#bitwise%5Foperators)\n* [Right shift assignment operator](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Right%5Fshift%5Fassignment)\n* [Unsigned right shift operator](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Unsigned%5Fright%5Fshift)\n\n### Found a content problem with this page?\n\n* [Edit the page on GitHub](https://github.com/mdn/content/edit/main/files/en-us/web/javascript/reference/operators/right%5Fshift/index.md \"This will take you to GitHub, where you'll need to sign in first.\").\n* [Report the content issue](https://github.com/mdn/content/issues/new?template=page-report.yml&mdn-url=https%3A%2F%2Fdeveloper.mozilla.org%2Fen-US%2Fdocs%2FWeb%2FJavaScript%2FReference%2FOperators%2FRight%5Fshift&metadata=%3C%21--+Do+not+make+changes+below+this+line+--%3E%0A%3Cdetails%3E%0A%3Csummary%3EPage+report+details%3C%2Fsummary%3E%0A%0A%2A+Folder%3A+%60en-us%2Fweb%2Fjavascript%2Freference%2Foperators%2Fright%5Fshift%60%0A%2A+MDN+URL%3A+https%3A%2F%2Fdeveloper.mozilla.org%2Fen-US%2Fdocs%2FWeb%2FJavaScript%2FReference%2FOperators%2FRight%5Fshift%0A%2A+GitHub+URL%3A+https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fmdn%2Fcontent%2Fblob%2Fmain%2Ffiles%2Fen-us%2Fweb%2Fjavascript%2Freference%2Foperators%2Fright%5Fshift%2Findex.md%0A%2A+Last+commit%3A+https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fmdn%2Fcontent%2Fcommit%2Fd85a7ba8cca98c2f6cf67a0c44f0ffd467532f20%0A%2A+Document+last+modified%3A+2023-04-05T04%3A57%3A48.000Z%0A%0A%3C%2Fdetails%3E \"This will take you to GitHub to file a new issue.\").\n* [View the source on GitHub](https://github.com/mdn/content/blob/main/files/en-us/web/javascript/reference/operators/right%5Fshift/index.md?plain=1 \"Folder: en-us/web/javascript/reference/operators/right_shift (Opens in a new tab)\").\nWant to get more involved?
