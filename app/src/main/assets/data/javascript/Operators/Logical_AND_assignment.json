For example, the following does not throw an error, despite `x` being `const`:\n\n```\nconst x = 0;\nx &&= 2;\n\n```\n\nNeither would the following trigger the setter:\n\n```\nconst x = {\n  get value() {\n    return 0;\n  },\n  set value(v) {\n    console.log(\"Setter called\");\n  },\n};\n\nx.value &&= 2;\n\n```\n\nIn fact, if `x` is not truthy, `y` is not evaluated at all.\n\n```\nconst x = 0;\nx &&= console.log(\"y evaluated\");\n// Logs nothing\n\n```\n\n## [Examples](#examples)\n\n### [Using logical AND assignment](#using%5Flogical%5Fand%5Fassignment)\n\n```\nlet x = 0;\nlet y = 1;\n\nx &&= 0; // 0\nx &&= 1; // 0\ny &&= 1; // 1\ny &&= 0; // 0\n\n```\n\n## [Specifications](#specifications)\n\n| Specification                                                                                                                                                     |\n| ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| [ECMAScript Language Specification  \\# sec-assignment-operators](https://tc39.es/ecma262/multipage/ecmascript-language-expressions.html#sec-assignment-operators) |\n\n## [Browser compatibility](#browser%5Fcompatibility)\n\nBCD tables only load in the browser\n\n## [See also](#see%5Falso)\n\n* [Logical AND (&&)](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Logical%5FAND)\n* [The nullish coalescing operator (??)](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Nullish%5Fcoalescing)\n* [Bitwise AND assignment (&=)](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Bitwise%5FAND%5Fassignment)\n* [Truthy](/en-US/docs/Glossary/Truthy)\n* [Falsy](/en-US/docs/Glossary/Falsy)\n\n### Found a content problem with this page?\n\n* [Edit the page on GitHub](https://github.com/mdn/content/edit/main/files/en-us/web/javascript/reference/operators/logical%5Fand%5Fassignment/index.md \"This will take you to GitHub, where you'll need to sign in first.\").\n* [Report the content issue](https://github.com/mdn/content/issues/new?template=page-report.yml&mdn-url=https%3A%2F%2Fdeveloper.mozilla.org%2Fen-US%2Fdocs%2FWeb%2FJavaScript%2FReference%2FOperators%2FLogical%5FAND%5Fassignment&metadata=%3C%21--+Do+not+make+changes+below+this+line+--%3E%0A%3Cdetails%3E%0A%3Csummary%3EPage+report+details%3C%2Fsummary%3E%0A%0A%2A+Folder%3A+%60en-us%2Fweb%2Fjavascript%2Freference%2Foperators%2Flogical%5Fand%5Fassignment%60%0A%2A+MDN+URL%3A+https%3A%2F%2Fdeveloper.mozilla.org%2Fen-US%2Fdocs%2FWeb%2FJavaScript%2FReference%2FOperators%2FLogical%5FAND%5Fassignment%0A%2A+GitHub+URL%3A+https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fmdn%2Fcontent%2Fblob%2Fmain%2Ffiles%2Fen-us%2Fweb%2Fjavascript%2Freference%2Foperators%2Flogical%5Fand%5Fassignment%2Findex.md%0A%2A+Last+commit%3A+https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fmdn%2Fcontent%2Fcommit%2Fd85a7ba8cca98c2f6cf67a0c44f0ffd467532f20%0A%2A+Document+last+modified%3A+2023-04-05T04%3A57%3A48.000Z%0A%0A%3C%2Fdetails%3E \"This will take you to GitHub to file a new issue.\").\n* [View the source on GitHub](https://github.com/mdn/content/blob/main/files/en-us/web/javascript/reference/operators/logical%5Fand%5Fassignment/index.md?plain=1 \"Folder: en-us/web/javascript/reference/operators/logical_and_assignment (Opens in a new tab)\").\nWant to get more involved?
