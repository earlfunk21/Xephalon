It first [coerces both operands to numeric values](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Data%5Fstructures#numeric%5Fcoercion) and tests the types of them. It performs BigInt division if both operands becomes BigInts; otherwise, it performs number division. A [TypeError](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global%5FObjects/TypeError) is thrown if one operand becomes a BigInt but the other becomes a number.\n\nFor BigInt division, the result is the quotient of the two operands truncated towards zero, and the remainder is discarded. A [RangeError](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global%5FObjects/RangeError) is thrown if the divisor `y` is `0n`. This is because number division by zero returns `Infinity` or `-Infinity`, but BigInt has no concept of infinity.\n\n## [Examples](#examples)\n\n### [Basic division](#basic%5Fdivision)\n\n```\n1 / 2; // 0.5\n\nMath.floor(3 / 2); // 1\n\n1.0 / 2.0; // 0.5\n\n1n / 2n; // 0n\n5n / 3n; // 1n\n-1n / 3n; // 0n\n1n / -3n; // 0n\n\n2n / 2; // TypeError: Cannot mix BigInt and other types, use explicit conversions\n\n// To do division with a BigInt and a non-BigInt, convert either operand\n2n / BigInt(2); // 1n\nNumber(2n) / 2; // 1\n\n```\n\n### [Division by zero](#division%5Fby%5Fzero)\n\n```\n2.0 / 0; // Infinity\n\n2.0 / 0.0; // Infinity, because 0.0 === 0\n\n2.0 / -0.0; // -Infinity\n\n2n / 0n; // RangeError: Division by zero\n\n```\n\n## [Specifications](#specifications)\n\n| Specification                                                                                                                                                             |\n| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| [ECMAScript Language Specification  \\# sec-multiplicative-operators](https://tc39.es/ecma262/multipage/ecmascript-language-expressions.html#sec-multiplicative-operators) |\n\n## [Browser compatibility](#browser%5Fcompatibility)\n\nBCD tables only load in the browser\n\n## [See also](#see%5Falso)\n\n* [Addition operator](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Addition)\n* [Subtraction operator](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Subtraction)\n* [Multiplication operator](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Multiplication)\n* [Remainder operator](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Remainder)\n* [Exponentiation operator](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Exponentiation)\n* [Increment operator](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Increment)\n* [Decrement operator](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Decrement)\n* [Unary negation operator](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Unary%5Fnegation)\n* [Unary plus operator](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Unary%5Fplus)\n\n### Found a content problem with this page?\n\n* [Edit the page on GitHub](https://github.com/mdn/content/edit/main/files/en-us/web/javascript/reference/operators/division/index.md \"This will take you to GitHub, where you'll need to sign in first.\").\n* [Report the content issue](https://github.com/mdn/content/issues/new?template=page-report.yml&mdn-url=https%3A%2F%2Fdeveloper.mozilla.org%2Fen-US%2Fdocs%2FWeb%2FJavaScript%2FReference%2FOperators%2FDivision&metadata=%3C%21--+Do+not+make+changes+below+this+line+--%3E%0A%3Cdetails%3E%0A%3Csummary%3EPage+report+details%3C%2Fsummary%3E%0A%0A%2A+Folder%3A+%60en-us%2Fweb%2Fjavascript%2Freference%2Foperators%2Fdivision%60%0A%2A+MDN+URL%3A+https%3A%2F%2Fdeveloper.mozilla.org%2Fen-US%2Fdocs%2FWeb%2FJavaScript%2FReference%2FOperators%2FDivision%0A%2A+GitHub+URL%3A+https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fmdn%2Fcontent%2Fblob%2Fmain%2Ffiles%2Fen-us%2Fweb%2Fjavascript%2Freference%2Foperators%2Fdivision%2Findex.md%0A%2A+Last+commit%3A+https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fmdn%2Fcontent%2Fcommit%2F93d2d79c1c68af93f2730d27cdea9d527eee0d7a%0A%2A+Document+last+modified%3A+2023-03-28T05%3A38%3A31.000Z%0A%0A%3C%2Fdetails%3E \"This will take you to GitHub to file a new issue.\").\n* [View the source on GitHub](https://github.com/mdn/content/blob/main/files/en-us/web/javascript/reference/operators/division/index.md?plain=1 \"Folder: en-us/web/javascript/reference/operators/division (Opens in a new tab)\").\nWant to get more involved?
