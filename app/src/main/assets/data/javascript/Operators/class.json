The `class` keyword only begins an expression when it appears in a context that cannot accept statements.\n\n## [Description](#description)\n\nA `class` expression is very similar to, and has almost the same syntax as, a [class declaration](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/class). As with `class` declarations, the body of a `class` expression is executed in [strict mode](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Strict%5Fmode). The main difference between a `class` expression and a `class` declaration is the _class name_, which can be omitted in `class` expressions to create _anonymous_ classes. Class expressions allow you to redefine classes, while redeclaring a class using `class` declarations throws a [SyntaxError](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global%5FObjects/SyntaxError). See also the chapter about [classes](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Classes) for more information.\n\n## [Examples](#examples)\n\n### [A simple class expression](#a%5Fsimple%5Fclass%5Fexpression)\n\nThis is just a simple anonymous class expression which you can refer to using the variable `Foo`.\n\n```\nconst Foo = class {\n  constructor() {}\n  bar() {\n    return \"Hello World!\";\n  }\n};\n\nconst instance = new Foo();\ninstance.bar(); // \"Hello World!\"\nFoo.name; // \"Foo\"\n\n```\n\n### [Named class expressions](#named%5Fclass%5Fexpressions)\n\nIf you want to refer to the current class inside the class body, you can create a _named class expression_. The name is only visible within the scope of the class expression itself.\n\n```\nconst Foo = class NamedFoo {\n  constructor() {}\n  whoIsThere() {\n    return NamedFoo.name;\n  }\n};\nconst bar = new Foo();\nbar.whoIsThere(); // \"NamedFoo\"\nNamedFoo.name; // ReferenceError: NamedFoo is not defined\nFoo.name; // \"NamedFoo\"\n\n```\n\n## [Specifications](#specifications)\n\n| Specification                                                                                                                                                         |\n| --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| [ECMAScript Language Specification  \\# sec-class-definitions](https://tc39.es/ecma262/multipage/ecmascript-language-functions-and-classes.html#sec-class-definitions) |\n\n## [Browser compatibility](#browser%5Fcompatibility)\n\nBCD tables only load in the browser\n\n## [See also](#see%5Falso)\n\n* [function](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/function) expression\n* [class](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/class) declaration\n* [Classes](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Classes)\n\n### Found a content problem with this page?\n\n* [Edit the page on GitHub](https://github.com/mdn/content/edit/main/files/en-us/web/javascript/reference/operators/class/index.md \"This will take you to GitHub, where you'll need to sign in first.\").\n* [Report the content issue](https://github.com/mdn/content/issues/new?template=page-report.yml&mdn-url=https%3A%2F%2Fdeveloper.mozilla.org%2Fen-US%2Fdocs%2FWeb%2FJavaScript%2FReference%2FOperators%2Fclass&metadata=%3C%21--+Do+not+make+changes+below+this+line+--%3E%0A%3Cdetails%3E%0A%3Csummary%3EPage+report+details%3C%2Fsummary%3E%0A%0A%2A+Folder%3A+%60en-us%2Fweb%2Fjavascript%2Freference%2Foperators%2Fclass%60%0A%2A+MDN+URL%3A+https%3A%2F%2Fdeveloper.mozilla.org%2Fen-US%2Fdocs%2FWeb%2FJavaScript%2FReference%2FOperators%2Fclass%0A%2A+GitHub+URL%3A+https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fmdn%2Fcontent%2Fblob%2Fmain%2Ffiles%2Fen-us%2Fweb%2Fjavascript%2Freference%2Foperators%2Fclass%2Findex.md%0A%2A+Last+commit%3A+https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fmdn%2Fcontent%2Fcommit%2F40574fa665cd58de35cc2d30de2a46f5e9d3b484%0A%2A+Document+last+modified%3A+2023-03-06T09%3A41%3A58.000Z%0A%0A%3C%2Fdetails%3E \"This will take you to GitHub to file a new issue.\").\n* [View the source on GitHub](https://github.com/mdn/content/blob/main/files/en-us/web/javascript/reference/operators/class/index.md?plain=1 \"Folder: en-us/web/javascript/reference/operators/class (Opens in a new tab)\").\nWant to get more involved?
