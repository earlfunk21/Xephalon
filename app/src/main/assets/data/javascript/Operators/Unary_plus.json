It can convert string representations of integers and floats, as well as the non-string values `true`, `false`, and `null`. Integers in both decimal and hexadecimal (`0x`\\-prefixed) formats are supported. Negative numbers are supported (though not for hex). If it cannot parse a particular value, it will evaluate to [NaN](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global%5FObjects/NaN). Unlike other arithmetic operators, which work with both numbers and [BigInts](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global%5FObjects/BigInt), using the `+` operator on BigInt values throws a [TypeError](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global%5FObjects/TypeError).\n\n## [Examples](#examples)\n\n### [Usage with numbers](#usage%5Fwith%5Fnumbers)\n\n```\nconst x = 1;\nconst y = -1;\n\nconsole.log(+x);\n// 1\nconsole.log(+y);\n// -1\n\n```\n\n### [Usage with non-numbers](#usage%5Fwith%5Fnon-numbers)\n\n```\n+true  // 1\n+false // 0\n+null  // 0\n+[]    // 0\n+function (val) { return val; } // NaN\n+1n    // throws TypeError: Cannot convert BigInt value to number\n\n```\n\n## [Specifications](#specifications)\n\n| Specification                                                                                                                                                   |\n| --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| [ECMAScript Language Specification  \\# sec-unary-plus-operator](https://tc39.es/ecma262/multipage/ecmascript-language-expressions.html#sec-unary-plus-operator) |\n\n## [Browser compatibility](#browser%5Fcompatibility)\n\nBCD tables only load in the browser\n\n## [See also](#see%5Falso)\n\n* [Addition operator](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Addition)\n* [Subtraction operator](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Subtraction)\n* [Division operator](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Division)\n* [Multiplication operator](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Multiplication)\n* [Remainder operator](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Remainder)\n* [Exponentiation operator](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Exponentiation)\n* [Increment operator](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Increment)\n* [Decrement operator](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Decrement)\n* [Unary negation operator](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Unary%5Fnegation)\n\n### Found a content problem with this page?\n\n* [Edit the page on GitHub](https://github.com/mdn/content/edit/main/files/en-us/web/javascript/reference/operators/unary%5Fplus/index.md \"This will take you to GitHub, where you'll need to sign in first.\").\n* [Report the content issue](https://github.com/mdn/content/issues/new?template=page-report.yml&mdn-url=https%3A%2F%2Fdeveloper.mozilla.org%2Fen-US%2Fdocs%2FWeb%2FJavaScript%2FReference%2FOperators%2FUnary%5Fplus&metadata=%3C%21--+Do+not+make+changes+below+this+line+--%3E%0A%3Cdetails%3E%0A%3Csummary%3EPage+report+details%3C%2Fsummary%3E%0A%0A%2A+Folder%3A+%60en-us%2Fweb%2Fjavascript%2Freference%2Foperators%2Funary%5Fplus%60%0A%2A+MDN+URL%3A+https%3A%2F%2Fdeveloper.mozilla.org%2Fen-US%2Fdocs%2FWeb%2FJavaScript%2FReference%2FOperators%2FUnary%5Fplus%0A%2A+GitHub+URL%3A+https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fmdn%2Fcontent%2Fblob%2Fmain%2Ffiles%2Fen-us%2Fweb%2Fjavascript%2Freference%2Foperators%2Funary%5Fplus%2Findex.md%0A%2A+Last+commit%3A+https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fmdn%2Fcontent%2Fcommit%2F93d2d79c1c68af93f2730d27cdea9d527eee0d7a%0A%2A+Document+last+modified%3A+2023-03-28T05%3A38%3A31.000Z%0A%0A%3C%2Fdetails%3E \"This will take you to GitHub to file a new issue.\").\n* [View the source on GitHub](https://github.com/mdn/content/blob/main/files/en-us/web/javascript/reference/operators/unary%5Fplus/index.md?plain=1 \"Folder: en-us/web/javascript/reference/operators/unary_plus (Opens in a new tab)\").\nWant to get more involved?
