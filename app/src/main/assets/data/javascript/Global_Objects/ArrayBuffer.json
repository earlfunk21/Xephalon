You cannot directly manipulate the contents of an `ArrayBuffer`; instead, you create one of the [typed array objects](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global%5FObjects/TypedArray) or a [DataView](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global%5FObjects/DataView) object which represents the buffer in a specific format, and use that to read and write the contents of the buffer.\n\nThe [ArrayBuffer()](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global%5FObjects/ArrayBuffer/ArrayBuffer) constructor creates a new `ArrayBuffer` of the given length in bytes. You can also get an array buffer from existing data, for example, from a [Base64](/en-US/docs/Glossary/Base64) string or [from a local file](/en-US/docs/Web/API/FileReader/readAsArrayBuffer).\n\n`ArrayBuffer` is a [transferable object](/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web%5FWorkers%5FAPI/Transferable%5Fobjects).\n\n## [Description](#description)\n\n### [Resizing ArrayBuffers](#resizing%5Farraybuffers)\n\n`ArrayBuffer` objects can be made resizable by including the `maxByteLength` option when calling the [ArrayBuffer()](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global%5FObjects/ArrayBuffer/ArrayBuffer) constructor. You can query whether an `ArrayBuffer` is resizable and what its maximum size is by accessing its [resizable](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global%5FObjects/ArrayBuffer/resizable) and [maxByteLength](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global%5FObjects/ArrayBuffer/maxByteLength) properties, respectively. You can assign a new size to a resizable `ArrayBuffer` with a [resize()](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global%5FObjects/ArrayBuffer/resize) call. New bytes are initialized to 0.\n\nThese features make resizing `ArrayBuffer`s more efficient â€” otherwise, you have to make a copy of the buffer with a new size. It also gives JavaScript parity with WebAssembly in this regard (WASM linear memory can be resized with [WebAssembly.Memory.prototype.grow()](/en-US/docs/WebAssembly/JavaScript%5Finterface/Memory/grow)).\n\n## [Constructor](#constructor)\n\n[ArrayBuffer()](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global%5FObjects/ArrayBuffer/ArrayBuffer)\n\nCreates a new `ArrayBuffer` object.\n\n## [Static properties](#static%5Fproperties)\n\n[ArrayBuffer\\[@@species\\]](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global%5FObjects/ArrayBuffer/@@species)\n\nThe constructor function that is used to create derived objects.\n\n## [Static methods](#static%5Fmethods)\n\n[ArrayBuffer.isView()](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global%5FObjects/ArrayBuffer/isView)\n\nReturns `true` if `arg` is one of the ArrayBuffer views, such as [typed array objects](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global%5FObjects/TypedArray) or a [DataView](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global%5FObjects/DataView). Returns `false` otherwise.\n\n## [Instance properties](#instance%5Fproperties)\n\nThese properties are defined on `ArrayBuffer.prototype` and shared by all `ArrayBuffer` instances.\n\n[ArrayBuffer.prototype.byteLength](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global%5FObjects/ArrayBuffer/byteLength)\n\nThe size, in bytes, of the `ArrayBuffer`. This is established when the array is constructed and can only be changed using the [ArrayBuffer.prototype.resize()](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global%5FObjects/ArrayBuffer/resize) method if the `ArrayBuffer` is resizable.\n\n[ArrayBuffer.prototype.constructor](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global%5FObjects/Object/constructor)\n\nThe constructor function that created the instance object. For `ArrayBuffer` instances, the initial value is the [ArrayBuffer](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global%5FObjects/ArrayBuffer/ArrayBuffer) constructor.\n\n[ArrayBuffer.prototype.maxByteLength](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global%5FObjects/ArrayBuffer/maxByteLength)\n\nThe read-only maximum length, in bytes, that the `ArrayBuffer` can be resized to. This is established when the array is constructed and cannot be changed.\n\n[ArrayBuffer.prototype.resizable](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global%5FObjects/ArrayBuffer/resizable)\n\nRead-only. Returns `true` if the `ArrayBuffer` can be resized, or `false` if not.\n\n`ArrayBuffer.prototype[@@toStringTag]`\n\nThe initial value of the [@@toStringTag](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global%5FObjects/Symbol/toStringTag) property is the string `\"ArrayBuffer\"`. This property is used in [Object.prototype.toString()](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global%5FObjects/Object/toString).\n\n## [Instance methods](#instance%5Fmethods)\n\n[ArrayBuffer.prototype.resize()](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global%5FObjects/ArrayBuffer/resize)\n\nResizes the `ArrayBuffer` to the specified size, in bytes.\n\n[ArrayBuffer.prototype.slice()](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global%5FObjects/ArrayBuffer/slice)\n\nReturns a new `ArrayBuffer` whose contents are a copy of this `ArrayBuffer`'s bytes from `begin` (inclusive) up to `end` (exclusive). If either `begin` or `end` is negative, it refers to an index from the end of the array, as opposed to from the beginning.\n\n## [Examples](#examples)\n\n### [Creating an ArrayBuffer](#creating%5Fan%5Farraybuffer)\n\nIn this example, we create a 8-byte buffer with a [Int32Array](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global%5FObjects/Int32Array) view referring to the buffer:\n\n```\nconst buffer = new ArrayBuffer(8);\nconst view = new Int32Array(buffer);\n\n```\n\n## [Specifications](#specifications)\n\n| Specification                                                                                                                                   |\n| ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| [ECMAScript Language Specification  \\# sec-arraybuffer-objects](https://tc39.es/ecma262/multipage/structured-data.html#sec-arraybuffer-objects) |\n\n## [Browser compatibility](#browser%5Fcompatibility)\n\nBCD tables only load in the browser\n\n## [See also](#see%5Falso)\n\n* [Polyfill of ArrayBuffer in core-js](https://github.com/zloirock/core-js#ecmascript-typed-arrays)\n* [JavaScript typed arrays](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Typed%5Farrays)\n* [SharedArrayBuffer](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global%5FObjects/SharedArrayBuffer)\n* [RangeError: invalid array length](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Errors/Invalid%5Farray%5Flength)\n\n### Found a content problem with this page?\n\n* [Edit the page on GitHub](https://github.com/mdn/content/edit/main/files/en-us/web/javascript/reference/global%5Fobjects/arraybuffer/index.md \"This will take you to GitHub, where you'll need to sign in first.\").\n* [Report the content issue](https://github.com/mdn/content/issues/new?template=page-report.yml&mdn-url=https%3A%2F%2Fdeveloper.mozilla.org%2Fen-US%2Fdocs%2FWeb%2FJavaScript%2FReference%2FGlobal%5FObjects%2FArrayBuffer&metadata=%3C%21--+Do+not+make+changes+below+this+line+--%3E%0A%3Cdetails%3E%0A%3Csummary%3EPage+report+details%3C%2Fsummary%3E%0A%0A%2A+Folder%3A+%60en-us%2Fweb%2Fjavascript%2Freference%2Fglobal%5Fobjects%2Farraybuffer%60%0A%2A+MDN+URL%3A+https%3A%2F%2Fdeveloper.mozilla.org%2Fen-US%2Fdocs%2FWeb%2FJavaScript%2FReference%2FGlobal%5FObjects%2FArrayBuffer%0A%2A+GitHub+URL%3A+https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fmdn%2Fcontent%2Fblob%2Fmain%2Ffiles%2Fen-us%2Fweb%2Fjavascript%2Freference%2Fglobal%5Fobjects%2Farraybuffer%2Findex.md%0A%2A+Last+commit%3A+https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fmdn%2Fcontent%2Fcommit%2F7b35a48ac0a10b67f9bd5270b082d40deff9c953%0A%2A+Document+last+modified%3A+2023-05-01T22%3A45%3A34.000Z%0A%0A%3C%2Fdetails%3E \"This will take you to GitHub to file a new issue.\").\n* [View the source on GitHub](https://github.com/mdn/content/blob/main/files/en-us/web/javascript/reference/global%5Fobjects/arraybuffer/index.md?plain=1 \"Folder: en-us/web/javascript/reference/global_objects/arraybuffer (Opens in a new tab)\").\nWant to get more involved?
