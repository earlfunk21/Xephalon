{"lang":"Javascript","fullPath":"/Global_Objects/encodeURI","category":"Global_Objects","title":"encodeURI","url":"/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/encodeURI","markdown":"# encodeURI()\n\nThe **`encodeURI()`** function encodes a [URI](/en-US/docs/Glossary/URI) by replacing each instance of certain characters by one, two, three, or four escape sequences representing the [UTF-8](/en-US/docs/Glossary/UTF-8) encoding of the character (will only be four escape sequences for characters composed of two surrogate characters). Compared to [encodeURIComponent()](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global%5FObjects/encodeURIComponent), this function encodes fewer characters, preserving those that are part of the URI syntax.\n\n## [Try it](#try%5Fit)\n\n## [Syntax](#syntax)\n\n```\nencodeURI(uri)\n\n```\n\n### [Parameters](#parameters)\n\n`uri`\n\nA string to be encoded as a URI.\n\n### [Return value](#return%5Fvalue)\n\nA new string representing the provided string encoded as a URI.\n\n### [Exceptions](#exceptions)\n\n[URIError](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global%5FObjects/URIError)\n\nThrown if `uri` contains a [lone surrogate](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global%5FObjects/String#utf-16%5Fcharacters%5Funicode%5Fcode%5Fpoints%5Fand%5Fgrapheme%5Fclusters).\n\n## [Description](#description)\n\n`encodeURI()` is a function property of the global object.\n\nThe `encodeURI()` function escapes characters by UTF-8 code units, with each octet encoded in the format `%XX`, left-padded with 0 if necessary. Because lone surrogates in UTF-16 do not encode any valid Unicode character, they cause `encodeURI()` to throw a [URIError](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global%5FObjects/URIError).\n\n`encodeURI()` escapes all characters **except**:\n\nA–Z a–z 0–9 - _ . ! ~ * ' ( )\n\n; / ? : @ & = + $ , #\n\nThe characters on the second line are characters that may be part of the URI syntax, and are only escaped by `encodeURIComponent()`. Both `encodeURI()` and `encodeURIComponent()` do not encode the characters `-.!~*'()`, known as \"unreserved marks\", which do not have a reserved purpose but are allowed in a URI \"as is\". (See [RFC2396](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2396.txt))\n\nThe `encodeURI()` function does not encode characters that have special meaning (reserved characters) for a URI. The following example shows all the parts that a URI can possibly contain. Note how certain characters are used to signify special meaning:\n\nhttp://username:password@www.example.com:80/path/to/file.php?foo=316&bar=this+has+spaces#anchor\n\n## [Examples](#examples)\n\n### [encodeURI() vs. encodeURIComponent()](#encodeuri%5Fvs.%5Fencodeuricomponent)\n\n`encodeURI()` differs from [encodeURIComponent()](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global%5FObjects/encodeURIComponent) as follows:\n\n```\nconst set1 = \";/?:@&=+$,#\"; // Reserved Characters\nconst set2 = \"-.!~*'()\"; // Unreserved Marks\nconst set3 = \"ABC abc 123\"; // Alphanumeric Characters + Space\n\nconsole.log(encodeURI(set1)); // ;/?:@&=+$,#\nconsole.log(encodeURI(set2)); // -.!~*'()\nconsole.log(encodeURI(set3)); // ABC%20abc%20123 (the space gets encoded as %20)\n\nconsole.log(encodeURIComponent(set1)); // %3B%2C%2F%3F%3A%40%26%3D%2B%24%23\nconsole.log(encodeURIComponent(set2)); // -.!~*'()\nconsole.log(encodeURIComponent(set3)); // ABC%20abc%20123 (the space gets encoded as %20)\n\n```\n\nNote that `encodeURI()` by itself _cannot_ form proper HTTP [GET](/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Methods/GET) and [POST](/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Methods/POST) requests, such as for [XMLHttpRequest](/en-US/docs/Web/API/XMLHttpRequest), because `&`, `+`, and `=` are not encoded, which are treated as special characters in `GET` and `POST` requests. `encodeURIComponent()`, however, does encode these characters.\n\n### [Encoding a lone high surrogate throws](#encoding%5Fa%5Flone%5Fhigh%5Fsurrogate%5Fthrows)\n\nA [URIError](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global%5FObjects/URIError) will be thrown if one attempts to encode a surrogate which is not part of a high-low pair. For example:\n\n```\n// High-low pair OK\nencodeURI(\"\\uD800\\uDFFF\"); // \"%F0%90%8F%BF\"\n\n// Lone high surrogate throws \"URIError: malformed URI sequence\"\nencodeURI(\"\\uD800\");\n\n// Lone low surrogate throws \"URIError: malformed URI sequence\"\nencodeURI(\"\\uDFFF\");\n\n```\n\nYou can use [String.prototype.toWellFormed()](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global%5FObjects/String/toWellFormed), which replaces lone surrogates with the Unicode replacement character (U+FFFD), to avoid this error. You can also use [String.prototype.isWellFormed()](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global%5FObjects/String/isWellFormed) to check if a string contains lone surrogates before passing it to `encodeURI()`.\n\n### [Encoding for RFC3986](#encoding%5Ffor%5Frfc3986)\n\nThe more recent [RFC3986](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc3986) makes square brackets reserved (for [IPv6](/en-US/docs/Glossary/IPv6)) and thus not encoded when forming something which could be part of a URL (such as a host). It also reserves !, ', (, ), and \\*, even though these characters have no formalized URI delimiting uses. The following function encodes a string for RFC3986-compliant URL format.\n\n```\nfunction encodeRFC3986URI(str) {\n  return encodeURI(str)\n    .replace(/%5B/g, \"[\")\n    .replace(/%5D/g, \"]\")\n    .replace(\n      /[!'()*]/g,\n      (c) => `%${c.charCodeAt(0).toString(16).toUpperCase()}`,\n    );\n}\n\n```\n\n## [Specifications](#specifications)\n\n| Specification                                                                                                                     |\n| --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| [ECMAScript Language Specification  \\# sec-encodeuri-uri](https://tc39.es/ecma262/multipage/global-object.html#sec-encodeuri-uri) |\n\n## [Browser compatibility](#browser%5Fcompatibility)\n\nBCD tables only load in the browser\n\n## [See also](#see%5Falso)\n\n* [decodeURI()](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global%5FObjects/decodeURI)\n* [encodeURIComponent()](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global%5FObjects/encodeURIComponent)\n* [decodeURIComponent()](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global%5FObjects/decodeURIComponent)\n\n### Found a content problem with this page?\n\n* [Edit the page on GitHub](https://github.com/mdn/content/edit/main/files/en-us/web/javascript/reference/global%5Fobjects/encodeuri/index.md \"This will take you to GitHub, where you'll need to sign in first.\").\n* [Report the content issue](https://github.com/mdn/content/issues/new?template=page-report.yml&mdn-url=https%3A%2F%2Fdeveloper.mozilla.org%2Fen-US%2Fdocs%2FWeb%2FJavaScript%2FReference%2FGlobal%5FObjects%2FencodeURI&metadata=%3C%21--+Do+not+make+changes+below+this+line+--%3E%0A%3Cdetails%3E%0A%3Csummary%3EPage+report+details%3C%2Fsummary%3E%0A%0A%2A+Folder%3A+%60en-us%2Fweb%2Fjavascript%2Freference%2Fglobal%5Fobjects%2Fencodeuri%60%0A%2A+MDN+URL%3A+https%3A%2F%2Fdeveloper.mozilla.org%2Fen-US%2Fdocs%2FWeb%2FJavaScript%2FReference%2FGlobal%5FObjects%2FencodeURI%0A%2A+GitHub+URL%3A+https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fmdn%2Fcontent%2Fblob%2Fmain%2Ffiles%2Fen-us%2Fweb%2Fjavascript%2Freference%2Fglobal%5Fobjects%2Fencodeuri%2Findex.md%0A%2A+Last+commit%3A+https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fmdn%2Fcontent%2Fcommit%2F5635446aa0127d686183ddd4fd5adcc34be567da%0A%2A+Document+last+modified%3A+2023-05-03T23%3A25%3A19.000Z%0A%0A%3C%2Fdetails%3E \"This will take you to GitHub to file a new issue.\").\n* [View the source on GitHub](https://github.com/mdn/content/blob/main/files/en-us/web/javascript/reference/global%5Fobjects/encodeuri/index.md?plain=1 \"Folder: en-us/web/javascript/reference/global_objects/encodeuri (Opens in a new tab)\").\nWant to get more involved?
