Though some browsers might still support it, it may have already been removed from the relevant web standards, may be in the process of being dropped, or may only be kept for compatibility purposes. Avoid using it, and update existing code if possible; see the [compatibility table](#browser%5Fcompatibility) at the bottom of this page to guide your decision. Be aware that this feature may cease to work at any time.\n\n**Note:** `escape()` is a non-standard function implemented by browsers and was only standardized for cross-engine compatibility. It is not required to be implemented by all JavaScript engines and may not work everywhere. Use [encodeURIComponent()](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global%5FObjects/encodeURIComponent) or [encodeURI()](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global%5FObjects/encodeURI) if possible.\n\nThe **`escape()`** function computes a new string in which certain characters have been replaced by hexadecimal escape sequences.\n\n## [Syntax](#syntax)\n\n```\nescape(str)\n\n```\n\n### [Parameters](#parameters)\n\n`str`\n\nA string to be encoded.\n\n### [Return value](#return%5Fvalue)\n\nA new string in which certain characters have been escaped.\n\n## [Description](#description)\n\n`escape()` is a function property of the global object.\n\nThe `escape()` function replaces all characters with escape sequences, with the exception of ASCII word characters (A–Z, a–z, 0–9, \\_) and `@*_+-./`. Characters are escaped by UTF-16 code units. If the code unit's value is less than 256, it is represented by a two-digit hexadecimal number in the format `%XX`, left-padded with 0 if necessary. Otherwise, it is represented by a four-digit hexadecimal number in the format `%uXXXX`, left-padded with 0 if necessary.\n\n**Note:** This function was used mostly for [URL encoding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/URL%5Fencoding) and is partly based on the escape format in [RFC 1738](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc1738). The escape format is _not_ an [escape sequence](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Lexical%5Fgrammar#escape%5Fsequences) in string literals. You can replace `%XX` with `\\xXX` and `%uXXXX` with `\\uXXXX` to get a string containing actual string-literal escape sequences.\n\n## [Examples](#examples)\n\n### [Using escape()](#using%5Fescape)\n\n```\nescape(\"abc123\"); // \"abc123\"\nescape(\"äöü\"); // \"%E4%F6%FC\"\nescape(\"ć\"); // \"%u0107\"\n\n// special characters\nescape(\"@*_+-./\"); // \"@*_+-./\"\n\n```\n\n## [Specifications](#specifications)\n\n| Specification                                                                                                                                                       |\n| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| [ECMAScript Language Specification  \\# sec-escape-string](https://tc39.es/ecma262/multipage/additional-ecmascript-features-for-web-browsers.html#sec-escape-string) |\n\n## [Browser compatibility](#browser%5Fcompatibility)\n\nBCD tables only load in the browser\n\n## [See also](#see%5Falso)\n\n* [Polyfill of escape in core-js](https://github.com/zloirock/core-js#ecmascript-string-and-regexp)\n* [encodeURI](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global%5FObjects/encodeURI)\n* [encodeURIComponent](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global%5FObjects/encodeURIComponent)\n* [unescape](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global%5FObjects/unescape)\n\n### Found a content problem with this page?\n\n* [Edit the page on GitHub](https://github.com/mdn/content/edit/main/files/en-us/web/javascript/reference/global%5Fobjects/escape/index.md \"This will take you to GitHub, where you'll need to sign in first.\").\n* [Report the content issue](https://github.com/mdn/content/issues/new?template=page-report.yml&mdn-url=https%3A%2F%2Fdeveloper.mozilla.org%2Fen-US%2Fdocs%2FWeb%2FJavaScript%2FReference%2FGlobal%5FObjects%2Fescape&metadata=%3C%21--+Do+not+make+changes+below+this+line+--%3E%0A%3Cdetails%3E%0A%3Csummary%3EPage+report+details%3C%2Fsummary%3E%0A%0A%2A+Folder%3A+%60en-us%2Fweb%2Fjavascript%2Freference%2Fglobal%5Fobjects%2Fescape%60%0A%2A+MDN+URL%3A+https%3A%2F%2Fdeveloper.mozilla.org%2Fen-US%2Fdocs%2FWeb%2FJavaScript%2FReference%2FGlobal%5FObjects%2Fescape%0A%2A+GitHub+URL%3A+https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fmdn%2Fcontent%2Fblob%2Fmain%2Ffiles%2Fen-us%2Fweb%2Fjavascript%2Freference%2Fglobal%5Fobjects%2Fescape%2Findex.md%0A%2A+Last+commit%3A+https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fmdn%2Fcontent%2Fcommit%2Fcb8b34d86ff9326a72c421dcf4430b450e6c8d5d%0A%2A+Document+last+modified%3A+2023-05-16T14%3A55%3A46.000Z%0A%0A%3C%2Fdetails%3E \"This will take you to GitHub to file a new issue.\").\n* [View the source on GitHub](https://github.com/mdn/content/blob/main/files/en-us/web/javascript/reference/global%5Fobjects/escape/index.md?plain=1 \"Folder: en-us/web/javascript/reference/global_objects/escape (Opens in a new tab)\").\nWant to get more involved?
