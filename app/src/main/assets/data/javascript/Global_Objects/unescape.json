Though some browsers might still support it, it may have already been removed from the relevant web standards, may be in the process of being dropped, or may only be kept for compatibility purposes. Avoid using it, and update existing code if possible; see the [compatibility table](#browser%5Fcompatibility) at the bottom of this page to guide your decision. Be aware that this feature may cease to work at any time.\n\n**Note:** `unescape()` is a non-standard function implemented by browsers and was only standardized for cross-engine compatibility. It is not required to be implemented by all JavaScript engines and may not work everywhere. Use [decodeURIComponent()](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global%5FObjects/decodeURIComponent) or [decodeURI()](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global%5FObjects/decodeURI) if possible.\n\nThe **`unescape()`** function computes a new string in which hexadecimal escape sequences are replaced with the characters that they represent. The escape sequences might be introduced by a function like [escape()](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global%5FObjects/escape).\n\n## [Syntax](#syntax)\n\n```\nunescape(str)\n\n```\n\n### [Parameters](#parameters)\n\n`str`\n\nA string to be decoded.\n\n### [Return value](#return%5Fvalue)\n\nA new string in which certain characters have been unescaped.\n\n## [Description](#description)\n\n`unescape()` is a function property of the global object.\n\nThe `unescape()` function replaces any escape sequence with the character that it represents. Specifically, it replaces any escape sequence of the form `%XX` or `%uXXXX` (where `X` represents one hexadecimal digit) with the character that has the hexadecimal value `XX`/`XXXX`. If the escape sequence is not a valid escape sequence (for example, if `%` is followed by one or no hex digit), it is left as-is.\n\n**Note:** This function was used mostly for [URL encoding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/URL%5Fencoding) and is partly based on the escape format in [RFC 1738](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc1738). The `unescape()` function does _not_ evaluate [escape sequences](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Lexical%5Fgrammar#escape%5Fsequences) in string literals. You can replace `\\xXX` with `%XX` and `\\uXXXX` with `%uXXXX` to get a string that can be handled by `unescape()`.\n\n## [Examples](#examples)\n\n### [Using unescape()](#using%5Funescape)\n\n```\nunescape(\"abc123\"); // \"abc123\"\nunescape(\"%E4%F6%FC\"); // \"äöü\"\nunescape(\"%u0107\"); // \"ć\"\n\n```\n\n## [Specifications](#specifications)\n\n| Specification                                                                                                                                                           |\n| ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| [ECMAScript Language Specification  \\# sec-unescape-string](https://tc39.es/ecma262/multipage/additional-ecmascript-features-for-web-browsers.html#sec-unescape-string) |\n\n## [Browser compatibility](#browser%5Fcompatibility)\n\nBCD tables only load in the browser\n\n## [See also](#see%5Falso)\n\n* [Polyfill of unescape in core-js](https://github.com/zloirock/core-js#ecmascript-string-and-regexp)\n* [decodeURI](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global%5FObjects/decodeURI)\n* [decodeURIComponent](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global%5FObjects/decodeURIComponent)\n* [escape](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global%5FObjects/escape)\n\n### Found a content problem with this page?\n\n* [Edit the page on GitHub](https://github.com/mdn/content/edit/main/files/en-us/web/javascript/reference/global%5Fobjects/unescape/index.md \"This will take you to GitHub, where you'll need to sign in first.\").\n* [Report the content issue](https://github.com/mdn/content/issues/new?template=page-report.yml&mdn-url=https%3A%2F%2Fdeveloper.mozilla.org%2Fen-US%2Fdocs%2FWeb%2FJavaScript%2FReference%2FGlobal%5FObjects%2Funescape&metadata=%3C%21--+Do+not+make+changes+below+this+line+--%3E%0A%3Cdetails%3E%0A%3Csummary%3EPage+report+details%3C%2Fsummary%3E%0A%0A%2A+Folder%3A+%60en-us%2Fweb%2Fjavascript%2Freference%2Fglobal%5Fobjects%2Funescape%60%0A%2A+MDN+URL%3A+https%3A%2F%2Fdeveloper.mozilla.org%2Fen-US%2Fdocs%2FWeb%2FJavaScript%2FReference%2FGlobal%5FObjects%2Funescape%0A%2A+GitHub+URL%3A+https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fmdn%2Fcontent%2Fblob%2Fmain%2Ffiles%2Fen-us%2Fweb%2Fjavascript%2Freference%2Fglobal%5Fobjects%2Funescape%2Findex.md%0A%2A+Last+commit%3A+https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fmdn%2Fcontent%2Fcommit%2Fcb8b34d86ff9326a72c421dcf4430b450e6c8d5d%0A%2A+Document+last+modified%3A+2023-05-16T14%3A55%3A46.000Z%0A%0A%3C%2Fdetails%3E \"This will take you to GitHub to file a new issue.\").\n* [View the source on GitHub](https://github.com/mdn/content/blob/main/files/en-us/web/javascript/reference/global%5Fobjects/unescape/index.md?plain=1 \"Folder: en-us/web/javascript/reference/global_objects/unescape (Opens in a new tab)\").\nWant to get more involved?
