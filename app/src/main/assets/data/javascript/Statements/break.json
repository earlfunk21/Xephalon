It can also be used to jump past a [labeled statement](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/label) when used within that labeled statement.\n\n## [Try it](#try%5Fit)\n\n## [Syntax](#syntax)\n\n```\nbreak;\nbreak label;\n\n```\n\n`label` Optional\n\nIdentifier associated with the label of the statement to break to. If the `break` statement is not nested within a loop or [switch](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/switch), then the label identifier is required.\n\n## [Description](#description)\n\nWhen `break;` is encountered, the program breaks out of the innermost `switch` or [looping](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements#iterations) statement and continues executing the next statement after that.\n\nWhen `break label;` is encountered, the program breaks out of the statement labeled with `label` and continues executing the next statement after that. The `break` statement needs to be nested within the referenced label. The labeled statement can be any statement (commonly a [block](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/block) statement); it does not have to be another loop statement.\n\nA `break` statement, with or without a following label, cannot be used at the top level of a script, module, function's body, or [static initialization block](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Classes/Static%5Finitialization%5Fblocks), even when the function or class is further contained within a loop.\n\n## [Examples](#examples)\n\n### [break in while loop](#break%5Fin%5Fwhile%5Floop)\n\nThe following function has a `break` statement that terminates the [while](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/while) loop when `i` is 3, and then returns the value `3 * x`.\n\n```\nfunction testBreak(x) {\n  let i = 0;\n\n  while (i < 6) {\n    if (i === 3) {\n      break;\n    }\n    i += 1;\n  }\n\n  return i * x;\n}\n\n```\n\n### [break in switch statements](#break%5Fin%5Fswitch%5Fstatements)\n\nThe following code has a `break` statement that terminates the [switch](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/switch) statement when a case is matched and the corresponding code has run.\n\n```\nconst food = \"sushi\";\n\nswitch (food) {\n  case \"sushi\":\n    console.log(\"Sushi is originally from Japan.\");\n    break;\n  case \"pizza\":\n    console.log(\"Pizza is originally from Italy.\");\n    break;\n  default:\n    console.log(\"I have never heard of that dish.\");\n    break;\n}\n\n```\n\n### [break in labeled blocks](#break%5Fin%5Flabeled%5Fblocks)\n\nThe following code uses `break` statements with labeled blocks. By using `break outerBlock`, control is transferred to the end of the block statement marked as `outerBlock`.\n\n```\nouterBlock: {\n  innerBlock: {\n    console.log(\"1\");\n    break outerBlock; // breaks out of both innerBlock and outerBlock\n    console.log(\":-(\"); // skipped\n  }\n  console.log(\"2\"); // skipped\n}\n\n```\n\n### [Unsyntactic break statements](#unsyntactic%5Fbreak%5Fstatements)\n\nA `break` statement must be nested within any label it references. The following code also uses `break` statements with labeled blocks, but generates a syntax error because its `break` statement references `block2` but it's not nested within `block2`.\n\n```\nblock1: {\n  console.log(\"1\");\n  break block2; // SyntaxError: label not found\n}\n\nblock2: {\n  console.log(\"2\");\n}\n\n```\n\nSyntax errors are also generated in the following code examples which use `break` statements within functions that are nested within a loop, or labeled block that the `break` statements are intended to break out of.\n\n```\nfunction testBreak(x) {\n  let i = 0;\n\n  while (i < 6) {\n    if (i === 3) {\n      (() => {\n        break;\n      })();\n    }\n    i += 1;\n  }\n\n  return i * x;\n}\n\ntestBreak(1); // SyntaxError: Illegal break statement\n\n```\n\n```\nblock1: {\n  console.log(\"1\");\n  (() => {\n    break block1; // SyntaxError: Undefined label 'block1'\n  })();\n}\n\n```\n\n## [Specifications](#specifications)\n\n| Specification                                                                                                                                                           |\n| ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| [ECMAScript Language Specification  \\# sec-break-statement](https://tc39.es/ecma262/multipage/ecmascript-language-statements-and-declarations.html#sec-break-statement) |\n\n## [Browser compatibility](#browser%5Fcompatibility)\n\nBCD tables only load in the browser\n\n## [See also](#see%5Falso)\n\n* [continue](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/continue)\n* [label](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/label)\n* [switch](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/switch)\n\n### Found a content problem with this page?\n\n* [Edit the page on GitHub](https://github.com/mdn/content/edit/main/files/en-us/web/javascript/reference/statements/break/index.md \"This will take you to GitHub, where you'll need to sign in first.\").\n* [Report the content issue](https://github.com/mdn/content/issues/new?template=page-report.yml&mdn-url=https%3A%2F%2Fdeveloper.mozilla.org%2Fen-US%2Fdocs%2FWeb%2FJavaScript%2FReference%2FStatements%2Fbreak&metadata=%3C%21--+Do+not+make+changes+below+this+line+--%3E%0A%3Cdetails%3E%0A%3Csummary%3EPage+report+details%3C%2Fsummary%3E%0A%0A%2A+Folder%3A+%60en-us%2Fweb%2Fjavascript%2Freference%2Fstatements%2Fbreak%60%0A%2A+MDN+URL%3A+https%3A%2F%2Fdeveloper.mozilla.org%2Fen-US%2Fdocs%2FWeb%2FJavaScript%2FReference%2FStatements%2Fbreak%0A%2A+GitHub+URL%3A+https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fmdn%2Fcontent%2Fblob%2Fmain%2Ffiles%2Fen-us%2Fweb%2Fjavascript%2Freference%2Fstatements%2Fbreak%2Findex.md%0A%2A+Last+commit%3A+https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fmdn%2Fcontent%2Fcommit%2F57ae0014c67f339b9af6252a451ddd40735ed243%0A%2A+Document+last+modified%3A+2023-03-31T06%3A45%3A22.000Z%0A%0A%3C%2Fdetails%3E \"This will take you to GitHub to file a new issue.\").\n* [View the source on GitHub](https://github.com/mdn/content/blob/main/files/en-us/web/javascript/reference/statements/break/index.md?plain=1 \"Folder: en-us/web/javascript/reference/statements/break (Opens in a new tab)\").\nWant to get more involved?
