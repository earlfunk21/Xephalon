May be either a declaration with [const](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/const), [let](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/let), or [var](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/var), or an [assignment](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Assignment) target (e.g. a previously declared variable or an object property).\n\n`object`\n\nObject whose non-symbol enumerable properties are iterated over.\n\n`statement`\n\nA statement to be executed on every iteration. May reference `variable`. You can use a [block statement](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/block) to execute multiple statements.\n\n## [Description](#description)\n\nThe loop will iterate over all enumerable properties of the object itself and those the object inherits from its prototype chain (properties of nearer prototypes take precedence over those of prototypes further away from the object in its prototype chain).\n\nA `for...in` loop only iterates over enumerable, non-symbol properties. Objects created from built–in constructors like `Array` and `Object` have inherited non–enumerable properties from `Array.prototype` and `Object.prototype`, such as [Array](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global%5FObjects/Array)'s [indexOf()](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global%5FObjects/Array/indexOf) method or [Object](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global%5FObjects/Object)'s [toString()](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global%5FObjects/Object/toString) method, which will not be visited in the `for...in` loop.\n\nThe traversal order, as of modern ECMAScript specification, is well-defined and consistent across implementations. Within each component of the prototype chain, all non-negative integer keys (those that can be array indices) will be traversed first in ascending order by value, then other string keys in ascending chronological order of property creation.\n\nThe `variable` part of `for...in` accepts anything that can come before the `=` operator. You can use [const](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/const) to declare the variable as long as it's not reassigned within the loop body (it can change between iterations, because those are two separate variables). Otherwise, you can use [let](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/let). You can use [destructuring](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Destructuring%5Fassignment) or an object property like `for (x.y in iterable)` as well.\n\nA [legacy syntax](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Deprecated%5Fand%5Fobsolete%5Ffeatures#statements) allows `var` declarations of the loop variable to have an initializer. This throws a [syntax error](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Errors/Invalid%5Ffor-in%5Finitializer) in strict mode and is ignored in non–strict mode.\n\n### [Deleted, added, or modified properties](#deleted%5Fadded%5For%5Fmodified%5Fproperties)\n\nIf a property is modified in one iteration and then visited at a later time, its value in the loop is its value at that later time. A property that is deleted before it has been visited will not be visited later. Properties added to the object over which iteration is occurring may either be visited or omitted from iteration.\n\nIn general, it is best not to add, modify, or remove properties from the object during iteration, other than the property currently being visited. There is no guarantee whether an added property will be visited, whether a modified property (other than the current one) will be visited before or after it is modified, or whether a deleted property will be visited before it is deleted.\n\n### [Array iteration and for...in](#array%5Fiteration%5Fand%5Ffor...in)\n\nArray indexes are just enumerable properties with integer names and are otherwise identical to general object properties. The `for...in` loop will traverse all integer keys before traversing other keys, and in strictly increasing order, making the behavior of `for...in` close to normal array iteration. However, the `for...in` loop will return all enumerable properties, including those with non–integer names and those that are inherited. Unlike `for...of`, `for...in` uses property enumeration instead of the array's iterator. In [sparse arrays](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Indexed%5Fcollections#sparse%5Farrays), `for...of` will visit the empty slots, but `for...in` will not.\n\nIt is better to use a [for](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/for) loop with a numeric index, [Array.prototype.forEach()](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global%5FObjects/Array/forEach), or the [for...of](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/for...of) loop, because they will return the index as a number instead of a string, and also avoid non-index properties.\n\n### [Iterating over own properties only](#iterating%5Fover%5Fown%5Fproperties%5Fonly)\n\nIf you only want to consider properties attached to the object itself, and not its prototypes, you can use one of the following techniques:\n\n* [Object.keys(myObject)](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global%5FObjects/Object/keys)\n* [Object.getOwnPropertyNames(myObject)](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global%5FObjects/Object/getOwnPropertyNames)\n\n`Object.keys` will return a list of enumerable own string properties, while `Object.getOwnPropertyNames` will also contain non-enumerable ones.\n\nMany JavaScript style guides and linters recommend against the use of `for...in`, because it iterates over the entire prototype chain which is rarely what one wants, and may be a confusion with the more widely-used `for...of` loop. `for...in` is most practically used for debugging purposes, being an easy way to check the properties of an object (by outputting to the console or otherwise). In situations where objects are used as ad hoc key-value pairs, `for...in` allows you check if any of those keys hold a particular value.\n\n## [Examples](#examples)\n\n### [Using for...in](#using%5Ffor...in)\n\nThe `for...in` loop below iterates over all of the object's enumerable, non-symbol properties and logs a string of the property names and their values.\n\n```\nconst obj = { a: 1, b: 2, c: 3 };\n\nfor (const prop in obj) {\n  console.log(`obj.${prop} = ${obj[prop]}`);\n}\n\n// Logs:\n// \"obj.a = 1\"\n// \"obj.b = 2\"\n// \"obj.c = 3\"\n\n```\n\n### [Iterating own properties](#iterating%5Fown%5Fproperties)\n\nThe following function illustrates the use of [Object.hasOwn()](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global%5FObjects/Object/hasOwn): the inherited properties are not displayed.\n\n```\nconst triangle = { a: 1, b: 2, c: 3 };\n\nfunction ColoredTriangle() {\n  this.color = \"red\";\n}\n\nColoredTriangle.prototype = triangle;\n\nconst obj = new ColoredTriangle();\n\nfor (const prop in obj) {\n  if (Object.hasOwn(obj, prop)) {\n    console.log(`obj.${prop} = ${obj[prop]}`);\n  }\n}\n\n// Logs:\n// \"obj.color = red\"\n\n```\n\n## [Specifications](#specifications)\n\n| Specification                                                                                                                                                                                     |\n| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| [ECMAScript Language Specification  \\# sec-for-in-and-for-of-statements](https://tc39.es/ecma262/multipage/ecmascript-language-statements-and-declarations.html#sec-for-in-and-for-of-statements) |\n\n## [Browser compatibility](#browser%5Fcompatibility)\n\nBCD tables only load in the browser\n\n## [See also](#see%5Falso)\n\n* [for...of](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/for...of)\n* [for](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/for)\n* [Enumerability and ownership of properties](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Enumerability%5Fand%5Fownership%5Fof%5Fproperties)\n* [Object.getOwnPropertyNames()](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global%5FObjects/Object/getOwnPropertyNames)\n* [Object.hasOwn()](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global%5FObjects/Object/hasOwn)\n* [Array.prototype.forEach()](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global%5FObjects/Array/forEach)\n\n### Found a content problem with this page?\n\n* [Edit the page on GitHub](https://github.com/mdn/content/edit/main/files/en-us/web/javascript/reference/statements/for...in/index.md \"This will take you to GitHub, where you'll need to sign in first.\").\n* [Report the content issue](https://github.com/mdn/content/issues/new?template=page-report.yml&mdn-url=https%3A%2F%2Fdeveloper.mozilla.org%2Fen-US%2Fdocs%2FWeb%2FJavaScript%2FReference%2FStatements%2Ffor...in&metadata=%3C%21--+Do+not+make+changes+below+this+line+--%3E%0A%3Cdetails%3E%0A%3Csummary%3EPage+report+details%3C%2Fsummary%3E%0A%0A%2A+Folder%3A+%60en-us%2Fweb%2Fjavascript%2Freference%2Fstatements%2Ffor...in%60%0A%2A+MDN+URL%3A+https%3A%2F%2Fdeveloper.mozilla.org%2Fen-US%2Fdocs%2FWeb%2FJavaScript%2FReference%2FStatements%2Ffor...in%0A%2A+GitHub+URL%3A+https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fmdn%2Fcontent%2Fblob%2Fmain%2Ffiles%2Fen-us%2Fweb%2Fjavascript%2Freference%2Fstatements%2Ffor...in%2Findex.md%0A%2A+Last+commit%3A+https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fmdn%2Fcontent%2Fcommit%2F0f3738f6b1ed1aa69395ff181207186e1ad9f4d8%0A%2A+Document+last+modified%3A+2023-02-21T00%3A33%3A34.000Z%0A%0A%3C%2Fdetails%3E \"This will take you to GitHub to file a new issue.\").\n* [View the source on GitHub](https://github.com/mdn/content/blob/main/files/en-us/web/javascript/reference/statements/for...in/index.md?plain=1 \"Folder: en-us/web/javascript/reference/statements/for...in (Opens in a new tab)\").\nWant to get more involved?
