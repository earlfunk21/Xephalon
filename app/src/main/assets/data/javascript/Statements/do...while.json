The condition is evaluated after executing the statement, resulting in the specified statement executing at least once.\n\n## [Try it](#try%5Fit)\n\n## [Syntax](#syntax)\n\n```\ndo\n  statement\nwhile (condition);\n\n```\n\n`statement`\n\n A statement that is executed at least once and is re-executed each time the condition evaluates to true. To execute multiple statements within the loop, use a[block](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/block) statement (`{ /* ... */ }`) to group those statements.\n\n`condition`\n\n An expression evaluated after each pass through the loop. If `condition` [evaluates to true](/en-US/docs/Glossary/Truthy), the `statement` is re-executed. When`condition` [evaluates to false](/en-US/docs/Glossary/Falsy), control passes to the statement following the `do...while`.\n\n Note: Use the [break](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/break) statement to stop a loop before `condition` evaluates to false.\n\n## [Examples](#examples)\n\n### [Using do...while](#using%5Fdo...while)\n\n In the following example, the `do...while` loop iterates at least once and reiterates until `i` is no longer less than 5.\n\n```\nlet result = \"\";\nlet i = 0;\ndo {\n  i += 1;\n  result += `${i} `;\n} while (i > 0 && i < 5);\n// Despite i === 0 this will still loop as it starts off without the test\n\nconsole.log(result);\n\n```\n\n### [Using an assignment as a condition](#using%5Fan%5Fassignment%5Fas%5Fa%5Fcondition)\n\nIn some cases, it can make sense to use an assignment as a condition â€” but when you do, there's a right way to do it, and a wrong way; the [while](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/while) documentation has a [Using an assignment as a condition](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/while#using%5Fan%5Fassignment%5Fas%5Fa%5Fcondition) section with an example showing a general best-practice syntax you should know about and follow.\n\n## [Specifications](#specifications)\n\n| Specification                                                                                                                                                                 |\n| ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| [ECMAScript Language Specification  \\# sec-do-while-statement](https://tc39.es/ecma262/multipage/ecmascript-language-statements-and-declarations.html#sec-do-while-statement) |\n\n## [Browser compatibility](#browser%5Fcompatibility)\n\nBCD tables only load in the browser\n\n## [See also](#see%5Falso)\n\n* [while](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/while)\n* [for](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/for)\n* [break](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/break)\n* [continue](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/continue)\n\n### Found a content problem with this page?\n\n* [Edit the page on GitHub](https://github.com/mdn/content/edit/main/files/en-us/web/javascript/reference/statements/do...while/index.md \"This will take you to GitHub, where you'll need to sign in first.\").\n* [Report the content issue](https://github.com/mdn/content/issues/new?template=page-report.yml&mdn-url=https%3A%2F%2Fdeveloper.mozilla.org%2Fen-US%2Fdocs%2FWeb%2FJavaScript%2FReference%2FStatements%2Fdo...while&metadata=%3C%21--+Do+not+make+changes+below+this+line+--%3E%0A%3Cdetails%3E%0A%3Csummary%3EPage+report+details%3C%2Fsummary%3E%0A%0A%2A+Folder%3A+%60en-us%2Fweb%2Fjavascript%2Freference%2Fstatements%2Fdo...while%60%0A%2A+MDN+URL%3A+https%3A%2F%2Fdeveloper.mozilla.org%2Fen-US%2Fdocs%2FWeb%2FJavaScript%2FReference%2FStatements%2Fdo...while%0A%2A+GitHub+URL%3A+https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fmdn%2Fcontent%2Fblob%2Fmain%2Ffiles%2Fen-us%2Fweb%2Fjavascript%2Freference%2Fstatements%2Fdo...while%2Findex.md%0A%2A+Last+commit%3A+https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fmdn%2Fcontent%2Fcommit%2F0f3738f6b1ed1aa69395ff181207186e1ad9f4d8%0A%2A+Document+last+modified%3A+2023-02-21T00%3A33%3A34.000Z%0A%0A%3C%2Fdetails%3E \"This will take you to GitHub to file a new issue.\").\n* [View the source on GitHub](https://github.com/mdn/content/blob/main/files/en-us/web/javascript/reference/statements/do...while/index.md?plain=1 \"Folder: en-us/web/javascript/reference/statements/do...while (Opens in a new tab)\").\nWant to get more involved?
